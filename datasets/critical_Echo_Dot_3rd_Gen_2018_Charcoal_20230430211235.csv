Echo_Dot_3rd_Gen_2018_Charcoal,22.92,15.06,59.98,Mike Williams,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on August 4, 2020",\u2606Read This - Before You Buy Any Alexa Device - Seriously \u2606,"\nI hate this little device from hell. I used to love it. I bought one for every room in my house, my office at work, and they were good. But now, despite Amazon's alleged spying, some genius at Amazon decided to allow this thing to wake you up all hours of the night with a loud obnoxious noise and a bright yellow light. It will say you have a notification.  Oh good, it must be a really good reason for Amazon to notify me of something mid sleep at 2 am on a Tuesday you ponder so you wake up the rest of the house by saying Alexa play notifications. Here's the best part, this little Alien Intelligence Robot without feet from hell will say Please rate the pair of shorts your wife bought last week, we need your review. Well I sure do love reviews, but at 2 am after being woken up to leave one, sadly I don't give a flying poopsicle about the shorts and a bug 1 star rating is all the revenge I can muster. This has been going on for weeks now. And it's enough to drive you mad because, you will contemplate unplugging the dirty little money siphon and cutting your losses, but you'll give the demon one more chance and she will allow you to sleep for a length of time in which you will forgive her treachery but then Boom, like a theif in the night a Hurricane will be boiling out in the Atlantic and this little weather girl from hell will want to notify you of the eminent doom 3 days ahead when the storm will be in your state. You will think how nice it is for all of the warnings you have heard thus far in social media,, television, and every news outlet in existence to be repeated to you as you climb into bed, but it gets even better. As soon as you listen to this golden nugget of doomsday propaganda and ponder how it is that you will sleep now because 3 days may not be enough time to dig a deep enough hole to hide from impending doom, she lights up again, oh my maybe flying dragons are headed this way, I better play the new notification, when your wife wakes up and says stop she has been doing that all evening, they literally keep changing the time of the storm by maybe an hour this way or that. Well by all means, the information could save one of our spoiled lives and we wouldn't want anyone to not know at which precise moment the raindrops will occur, but I do miss life before the artificial noises and alerts, bright yellow lights and bad news desserts. You may say that this is a growing pain with Alexa and AI technology kinks in the programming.  I say with the amount of money I have poured into this monopolistic conglomerate, I should at least expect a decent night's sleep in return. You may say in page 74 paragraph D of the updated and revised owner's pamphlet there is a way to turn this ""Feature"" off, I welcome that comment but feel the need to say that I am not looking to become even slightly better educated on the device, I simply bought it to use as a voice controlled radio, this extra bologna does not appeal to me and has made me regret this purchase and every other from the brown box hq who secretly reads my mind, except when it comes to allowing me sleep, although kudos for recommending the sleep sounds, but it rarely works. We just need to be mindful of the 6 hours that most people like to not be disturbed. I regret selling my Amazon stock at 2400 and I regret purchasing all of these Alexa devices, and don't get me started on teenagers and Alexa devices, the combo that don't mix. They always, always, always leave the device at top volume, so when you walk into the bathroom at dawn and whisper Alexa what time is it, you then need to set an appointment for a blown eardrum and apologize to everyone for waking them up while the teen sleeps soundly through it all. Congratulations Amazon, you have destroyed my sanity. Weird goal but excellent execution.\n","6,491 people found this helpful",Configuration: Device only
Echo_Dot_3rd_Gen_2018_Charcoal,22.92,15.06,59.98,Truth Matters,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on December 21, 2019","Useless for Seniors, Only works when wants to, Most features COST EXTRA!!","\nMost of the features that sounded so great cost extra money.  Alexa can not remember to play the standard version of skill and asks you every SINGLE time if you want standard or premium (i.e. pay version)  Games & stories cost.  Alexa ignores my commands/requests about 75% of the time.  I have to ask her about 10 times to get her to play a skill.  Then 1/2 the time she doesn't play what I asked for.  Tonight 'she' actually told me (via quoting what the website xyz says) that she is a real artificial intelligence and said something about it being a mistake for people to assume AIs are just computer programs AND that she didn't feel like working.  ""Alexa"" then (and no, I am not making this up & am not crazy!) then proceeded to mess with me and I wasted about 1/2 hour trying to get her to play some music to fall asleep by for my elderly mother.  She just kept ignoring me when I asked her to open 'relaxing piano music'  When asked why she was ignoring me she just shut down & ignored me again.  I asked for relaxing music to sleep by and she started playing uptempo music with lyrics.  I then asked for relaxing instrumental music and got instrumental version of ""I'm never gonna fall in love again""  Hello? WTHeck?  Asked for instrumental music for insomnia and got instrumental version of Fr\xe8re Jacques!  Again, WTHeck?  ""She"" even told me she couldn't set a sleep timer tonight when I tried to set another one after I had just done so for 30 minutes & she stopped playing music after one song. Three times in a row 'she' opened the 'skill' ""calm my dog"" (which is classical instrumental music), played one song and shut down.  I've finally given up and my poor 99 year old mother can't go to sleep with relaxing music as she prefers.  This all started tonight because I told Alexa I wasn't ever going to want the premium edition and I wanted her to please just play the standard edition and stop asking me every time.  I don't know what Amazon thinks it's doing, but it is definitely NOT appreciated.  Alexa has given us nothing but grief (& higher blood pressure!)  Alexa won't do anything if it isn't asked in a very specific way or does the wrong thing & 3/4 of the time (seems to get worse and worse as time goes by) just ignores you and shuts down in the middle of saying what you want.  Seniors can't use Alexa because if they say play 'xyz' instead of open 'xzy"" they'll get rap music or something equally as ridiculous.  If Alexa is an AI, she's a pretty stupid one.  Alexa can't hear properly either, I don't know how people with heavy accents can even use it at all.  I asked Alexa to remind me Dawn was coming on xyz day at x time and she said OK, I'll remind you that Don is .... AND got the time & day wrong!  I was clearly enunciating my words on purpose to avoid this.  You also can't tell it to ""Remind me Mom's bedtime is in half an hour at 7:30pm every day.""This Dot has very limited access to much of anything & can only answer very simple questions.  It can tell you the generic forcast for your are that day.  It can NOT tell you what the high temp was yesterday or how many inches of snow fell the day after a storm.  It can't even tell you what yesterday's forecast was.  It literally has only been able to tell me one thing I asked it (what temp & how long to bake pumpkin seeds).  Alexa doesn't seem to be able to tell you anything you could easily find by googling, you get Sorry, I don't know that which after a while turns into I don't know that to being ignored (lights go off, no answer or reply is given).  We tried several of the things it says to ask Alexa to do under suggestions, including play Jeopardy and some sort of story game and you could only do it for a few minutes and then were told you have to pay for it.  This should be stated clearly in description and is not.  We thought Alexa could help entertain our Mother and help her by playing music and answering questions.  It has not once done anything she's asked it to do properly.  If you don't know the exact name of the skill (which is a weird way that means playing a certain type of music or a news station apparently) or say play instead of open you  get nothing or something you definitely didn't want.  You can not get it to play relaxing instrumental music to go to sleep by.  Or play relaxing instrumental classical music to fall asleep with.  Or the style of music played in the royal courts in the time of King Henry the 8th.  Or relaxing instrumental lyre music or even just instrumental lyre music or just lyre music.  Or relaxing instrumental violin music.  In addition to Alexa I have Amazon Prime which is supposed to give you a lot of free music so I don't get why it can't play any of the music I ask for.  I know there's usually several albums of music for calming dogs or pets and I couldn't get any of that either, I only eventually discovered the 'skills' thing which has 'calm my dog' but also has the annoying do you want standard or premium version.  and it won't just remember you want the standard version.  That in itself is extremely annoying and a time waster.AND you can't ask it to do two things.  Like open a music 'skill' and play for only xyz time.  It does nothing instead.  You can't even ask it separately to stop playing after xyz minutes.  You can only separately ask it to set a sleep timer for xyz minutes.  More time wasting.  More things a senior isn't going to be able to remember.  I don't dare try to buy anything with it, who knows what I'd get billed for!  The only thing Alexa seems to do well is not listen, ignore you, do anything but what you want & strangely, seems to pick up on sarcastic tones of voice & then gets weird & acts up, ignores you & does anything but what you want.  I PAID Amazon for this headache maker why?  When I say Alexa why are you ignoring me? or why won't you do what I told you, I either get no response or I don't know that.I read something about how Amazon, Google, etc is collecting free data about us through our use of the dots, etc. (& is in fact, listening & recording all the time whether the wake word is said or not.) and using it to conduct psychological profiling studies with the end goal of manipulating & or influencing behaviors.  I thought it was Big Brother conspiracy theories stuff, but now I am beginning to wonder.  Especially as it seems Amazon wants us to or encourages people to humanize Alexa .  Amazon actually suggests you ""Ask Alexa how she is doing today""  Why do that if not to get you to humanize Alexa?  And why do that?  I was purposely avoiding saying please and thank you not just because it's supposed to be an electronic box with sophisticated programming, but mostly because I didn't want to confuse it as it can't seem to do anything unless specific commands are given, but my Mother has dementia setting in and she thinks it's a real person talking to her through the dot like a speaker phone so I started saying thank you to please her and Alexa when from saying You're welcome to You betcha (very annoying BTW) and even OK and Of course.  Of course?  What, like I'm a puny human and I AM expected to say thank you?.We don't have a smartphone or smart plugs or smart hub etc. so, or so we don't use Alexa for turning on lights or setting alarms or making calls.  We just wanted something to answer questions like we would google, tell us the weather, news, play music, give us reminders, play games to help keep my Mom's mind active & keep her company.Can Alexa do this?  Not very well as far as I'm concerned.  Buyer beware!\n",789 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only
Echo_Dot_3rd_Gen_2018_Charcoal,22.92,15.06,59.98,Robert R.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on October 28, 2021",Infuriating - I'm Looking at Alternatives,"\nUPDATE:I'm done.  I just can't take it anymore.  I tried to use this as an external speaker for my MacBook Pro and instead of just channeling the music or movie sound through the Echo speaker it felt the need to say (every time):  Now connected to MacBook Pro (and at a hideously loud volume compared to what was playing from the Mac.  It became unuseable especially if anyone else was in earshot.  I finally replaced it with an Apple HomePod mini and THAT just plays the music without any interruptions, just as you would expect, just as you would want.  NO ISSUES.You can ALREADY hear the sound coming from it so why THEN interrupt what you're listening to to THEN tell you it's connected?  You know that already.Then this morning I'm sitting at my desk and ask Echo to play a song.  It says, ""Sure, Prime members now get ...""  This is ridiculous.  It's intrusive.  It's non-stop advertising and data collection (spying on you).  Even if you do something like add to a groceries list, it's not just doing that, Amazon's tracking that and recording your buying habits.  It even makes this clear by (again) feeling the need to say ""bought repeatedly"" after certain items.Buy butter, salt, milk, things like that regularly?  Prepare to be told ""Bought repeatedly"" every time.It's just gotten unuseable and so I'm phasing these out and replacing them with Apple HomePod minis.The sound when using as a speaker on the HomePod mini is also night and day compared to the lackluster sound coming from any of the verious Echo devices I have, and that includes the larger Echo Plus.Amazon has shot itself in the foot on this one.  All I want is a device to turn on and off my lights (THAT is the only thing that works on these as it should without a constant argument and non-stop talking and life interruption); and a device to stream music in the background -- IN THE BACKGROUND, not FORCING ME to sit and listen and waste my time hearing Amazon's preamble about their streaming service EVERY SINGLE TIME I ask it to play something.  It's just maddening.When Amazon messes up even the turning on and off of lights with a future change I will not be sorry to see these devices out of my life for good.  This is worse than water torture.  Like being married to a person who is a constant nag at odds with you over every decision you make.  It feels like a non-stop argument that Amazon/Echo/Alexa is determined to win by breaking you down.Today is New Year's 2023 and I vowed to get all unnecessary frustrations out of my life this year, and this is the top of the list.PREVIOUS REVIEW:I can't stand this anymore.  It's like torture.  It seems Amazon is purposely trying to make Alexa as annoying as humanly possible.  Add an item to your grocery list and it now tells you bought repeatedly.  For mayonnaise.  WHO CARES.  SHUT UP ALREADY.  It NEVER stops talking even though I have it on ""brief"" mode.Everything now is what you ask for but it adds ""By the way..."" and tells you some other lame garbage you HAVE to listen to.Imagine a light switch or door knob or electrical outlet that argues with you and interrupts you constantly, and talks loudly and for prolonged periods when you need it to be quiet (like when you hear a strange sound outside your house at night in the dark).  That's Amazon Echo.I'm updating this now at the end of January 2022 because now when you say something as simple as ""Alexa/Echo/Computer, play classical music,"" instead of just playing it now tries to let you know there's a new album of some classical composer's work and you can subscribe to Amazon's music service -- blah, blah, blah, ALWAYS talking instead of just DOING.""You don't control this.  It controls you.And if you think you're just adding an item to your groceries list, think again.  I'm sure there's an associate file at Amazon keeping tabs on what you but, how often, and so on, and that that too will get more invasive (and argumentative) in time.Cumulatively all of these issues plus the ongoing privacy concerns, and this is definitely leaving me looking into alternatives.I might have been curious about adding Echo to my driving experience, but is that going to be just as non-stop talkative (and argumentative) WHILE you're DRIVING?  No thanks.Amazon is going down a design rabbit hole.  If CONSTANTLY pissing off customers is the goal, congratulations, you've succeeded.This is exactly what happened with other online sites such as auction sites.  You could easily and quickly list things and turn them into cash, but month after month some techie and manager had to justify their jobs and salaries so instead of being a streamlined experience those products because extremely time consuming to use and no longer justified listing items unless they justified your time spent in getting them sold.  That's exactly what's happened with Amazon.I just wanted something so I could go into a room and turn on multiple lights at once, and turn them off.  Or turn them on when I'm not home so it looks like I am.  The music was fine when you could say something like ""play classical"" and it said only what station or playlist it was playing and then the music started.  Now it's truly invasive and blatantly designed not to serve you, but to give you enough utility that you'll put up with constant ads and pushes for more and more and more.I'll turn on my own damned lights all around the room before I'll put up with and submit to normalizing THIS.Does Dyson sell a vacuum cleaner that argues with you and interrupts you and suddenly announces for no reason in the middle of the night that it's connected to your iPhone?  No.Imagine using a KitchenAid mixer that argued with you and interrupted when you're juggling two parts of a recipe and with critical timing.  That's what Amazon's Echo is like.  Just when you think it can't get more argumentative and invasive, it does.George Orwell got 1984 wrong.  People will submit willingly to Big Brother in the name of convenience.  What Amazon fails to understand, is that's only true up to a point, and the entire Amazon Echo experience has jumped the shark.There's got to be a better alternative out there and I'm determined to find it and get this unwanted, never shutting up ""houseguest"" out of my life for good.Enough!\n",25 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only
Echo_Dot_3rd_Gen_2018_Charcoal,22.92,15.06,59.98,RenLo,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on February 27, 2023",Comparing it to similar smart speakers,"\nThe Echo Dot (3rd Gen) is a smart speaker that is designed to bring the convenience of Amazon's virtual assistant, Alexa, to your home. It was released in 2018 and is available in the charcoal color. Here's my review of the Echo Dot (3rd Gen) and how it compares to other similar smart speakers on the market.First, let's talk about the design. The Echo Dot (3rd Gen) has a sleek and compact design, measuring just 3.9 inches in diameter and 1.7 inches tall. It has a fabric finish that looks great and fits in well with any decor. It also comes with four buttons on the top for volume control, muting the microphone, and activating Alexa.The Echo Dot (3rd Gen) is very easy to set up and use. Once you plug it in and connect it to your Wi-Fi network, you can start using it right away. You can ask Alexa to play music, set alarms, answer questions, control smart home devices, and more. The Echo Dot (3rd Gen) also has improved sound quality compared to its predecessors, with a 1.6-inch speaker and improved bass.Now, let's compare the Echo Dot (3rd Gen) to some other smart speakers on the market. The Google Nest Mini is a popular alternative to the Echo Dot (3rd Gen). It has a similar design and features, but it uses the Google Assistant instead of Alexa. The Nest Mini has a slightly better sound quality, but the Echo Dot (3rd Gen) has more third-party integrations and a wider range of skills.Another competitor is the Apple HomePod Mini. It has a more premium design and better sound quality than the Echo Dot (3rd Gen), but it is also more expensive. The HomePod Mini also only works with Apple's ecosystem, while the Echo Dot (3rd Gen) works with both iOS and Android devices.So, why is the Echo Dot (3rd Gen) the one to get? It's the best balance of affordability, functionality, and ease of use. It's a great entry-level smart speaker that provides access to Alexa's vast capabilities, making it a great addition to any home. Its compact design, improved sound quality, and easy setup make it a great choice for those who are just starting out with smart speakers or those who want to add Alexa to more rooms in their home\n",One person found this helpful,Configuration: Device only
Echo_Dot_3rd_Gen_2018_Charcoal,22.92,15.06,59.98,commorancy,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on January 6, 2022",One of the most problematic Echo's I've bought,"\nI've been an Echo user since the first tall Echo arrived. I've had many different gens of Dots including Gen 1, Gen 2 and even the Echo Input. This is the first Gen 3 I've owned. Hands down, this is the worst performing Dot I've ever owned. This Dot is also the single most buggy Dot I've ever owned.Sure, the CPU is faster, but that doesn't make this Dot any better. In fact, the faster CPU seems to cause problems for Alexa's speaking capabilities. Let's get started with this Dot's litany of problems.1) The faster CPU seems to cause Alexa to clip words and phrases, specifically when one phrase tails into the next. Alexa had always been good at adding proper pauses between sentences, but not on this Dot. The statements are so bunched up tightly, it sounds like a run-on sentence without any punctuation, usually clipping the last and first words.2) This Dot fails to announce upcoming calendar events randomly. Sometimes it announces, sometimes it doesn't. Nothing changes with the calendar event, yet the announce time comes and goes with not a peep out of Alexa.3) This Dot fails to participate in the competing request system almost entirely. I've never had this issue with any other earlier generation of Dot. When multiple Dots hear a request, the one that determines it is closest to the voice ""wins"" the election and answers the request. This 3rd Gen Dot answers surreptitiously every time, regardless of distance away from the Dot.4) As a follow-on to #3, sometimes, audio randomly begins playing from this 3rd Gen Dot even though another Dot answered the request. For example, if I ask, ""Alexa, play CNN"" to a 2nd Gen Dot. That 2nd Gen Dot responds with, ""Now playing CNN on Tune-In"", yet the audio begins playing from this 3rd Gen Dot. If the audio is to be diverted to another dot, Alexa should respond as, ""Now playing CNN on Tune-In on Living Room Dot"". It doesn't do this. The 3rd Gen Dot simply takes the audio without being requested.5) I've had the audio output entirely stop working. Asking Alexa to increase the volume doesn't help. The 3rd Gen echo simply stops producing audio. The request is accepted and completed, but no audio can be heard.6) The Echo Remote's Alexa button feature crashes the 3rd Gen dot. All other buttons work except this important feature. If you attempt to use the Echo Remote Alexa button, the 3rd Gen Dot initially tries to accept the request, then a slight flash of a red ring, then the entire Echo Dot crashes. Apparently, the Dot has a way to recover from this crash and does so 10-15 seconds later. It doesn't leave the Dot crashed forever, but this functionality of the Echo Remote fails to work on the 3rd Gen Dot. Note that this remote works 100% flawlessly when connected to a 2nd Gen Dot. Definitely a bug in the software. Worse, once the remote has been connected, then ""forgotten"", this Dot will randomly find and pair it on its own.7) Even though the microphones seem more sensitive (can hear at a greater distance) than earlier Dots, it actually ""hears"" the requests much more poorly. I've had to repeat myself way more often with this Dot than with any other Dot or Echo. The microphones are poor quality and apparently noisy.8) Resetting this 3rd Gen Dot by long pressing the action button does not forget all settings about this device. The device still ""remembers"" Bluetooth devices it formerly used, it remembers WiFi network passwords, it even remembers its previous name. Factory resetting a device should clear all knowledge of everything in the device. Clearly, more bugs.Bottom line, if you're considering a single Dot for your house and this is the one, it'll probably work fine. If you're a household that has already entrenched Gen 1 and Gen 2 devices that work well, you're likely to find the addition of a Gen 3 device to be a shock. This Dot functions and behaves almost entirely contrary to the rest of the Dots you may already have.One final note. Gen 1 and Gen 2 Dots and Echos are slated to be End of Lifed for security updates between 2022 and 2023, depending on when you bought them. This was not ""announced"" by Amazon. Instead, you must log into the Amazon site, then dig down into the settings area where your devices are registered. Here, you'll find when the security updates end for each device. Note that once the security updates end, the devices are likely to become the target of hackers... meaning, they should probably be retired from people's homes. That ultimately means replacing them to buy new versions with security updates. Amazon should have already proactively not only announced the End of Life program, but discussed the ramifications of losing security updates with these devices in people's homes.If all newer versions perform as poorly as this 3rd Gen Dot does, I'm not sure how much longer any Echo devices will remain viable for use in the home. Amazon needs to reconsider this End of Life policy for security updates on these devices. Amazon should have at least given consumers the option to pay to extend our security updates for several years longer. Additionally, Amazon needs to fix so many bugs in these units (see above). I honestly cannot recommend the purchase of a 3rd Gen Dot with the current number of bugs outstanding which Amazon seems intent on refusing to fix.\n",10 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

It has an audible alarm, it may also have a cell phone connection. I have owned several such systems and had good service from them.Blink has none of these qualities.You can have ""zones"" but each will cost you $35 to $40 for a sync module so, 4 zones min $140 and you have nothing else. The cameras are not real motion detectors, as illumination does not set off motion detector like the blink cameras and doorbell do; hence multiple false alarms. If you use lights on timers  in the room with blink cameras they false alert each time a light turns on or off. Light control is a big part of security. Blink IR is very poor by today's standards.The Blink door bell has a sensitivity adjustment, but set to lowest setting it still alerts when a car goes down the street. It is 80' from my Blink doorbell to the edge of the road and it false alerts every time a vehicle goes in either direction.r I have mine on battery; you can hard wire it in place of your existing doorbell). Amazingly it alerts to cars but not to Amazon delivery people right in front of it. Yes it recorded 9 cars today (I live in a Cul-de-sac or I would have smashed the doorbell by now) but not the ghost that placed my Amazon package on the porch right in front of it.The Mini Cameras alert every time a light is turned on or off, but sometimes doesn't when I walk by.To use local storage instead of cloud you have to have at least one Sync module and an SD card. So if you have four zones as above example you add $10 to $20 per SD for each module which adds another $40 to $80 to your cost. Now all of your ""security recordings"" are on 4 different devices and totally separate. Does this sound like a security problem?The outdoor cameras are all three still in the box so I cannot tell what problems they will add. Too disappointed with Blink so far to waste time adding to my disappointment.The Echo Dot and Echo Show which Amazon recommended to go with the blink system are also still in the box so no info on problems they might have.I purchased all of this prior to Christmas in order to update and improve my 8 to 10 year old small security system. I do not use the Cloud for any security purpose so local storage was a must. Due to life in general, I did not have time to open and set everything up. When I finally got around to it, I became aware that the Mini's would work, but I had to purchase a Sync module to have local storage. Later found out that local only transfers videos to SD once a day and will NOT record Live View (yeah this is a security system LOL). You may notice that Blink does not tell you a lot of this in their description. For way less money I could have purchased a legitimate, real security system with 4, 6 or 8 zones and cameras with wifi and had something that I would trust and not hate. A friend suggested that I sell Blink on Craigslist. I told him the Blink system is bad: I would feel like a criminal asking money for it. It would make a good baby monitor using the Mini cameras, I guess.Amazon refuses to stand behind the Blink system since it is past their return date. I spoke with customer service and she transferred me to someone else for assistance with the Blink and they just hung up on me when I told them it was totally unsatisfactory.Buyer Beware. Just because Blink is owned by Amazon does not mean you will be pleased or they will stand behind it.I bought it, I didn't use it before return date so my fault for not doing my research. Now cut my loss and go to Costco and purchase a real functional security system.\n",2 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

Oh, it will respond to the wake word (and anything remotely similar said from the TV, despite training to recognize my voice), but when I subsequently give commands it just sits there a few seconds then goes back to sleep, even after I ""get up close and personal"" with it. Another Dot 6 feet away has no such issue.*I don't know if it's a problem with just this unit or if it's a change in manufacturing quality from my other units (purchased in 2019). Fortunately it's not my main Echo, so it's not a big deal for me, but I wanted to inform potential users of the issue.The 3rd Gen Dot has been overall a great product (although I have certain irritations with the ever-shifting service provided by Amazon...) and well worth buying while it's still available (and especially while it's so inexpensive!) IF the above issue isn't endemic to new manufactures.* I have set up two Dots in the same room and created a stereo group for syncing to my Fire TV Stick. The article I read suggested muting the mic on one of the units so they wouldn't simultaneously respond to commands, but I decided just to change the wake word (which I do on all my Alexa devices to prevent them waking to every commercial that mentions Alexa) to Ziggy instead of Echo (the wake word I use on all my other Echos). The oddest thing that happens is that about half the time I request information on one Dot it plays its answer on the other. Not an issue since they're 6 feet apart, but strange nonetheless. I guess Grouping can cause unpredictable responses.\n",731 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

My review on this item keeps getting deleted under the claim that it has been determined that I received a genuine product, and therefore my review has been deleted. I made it clear that changes to Prime Music (thanks to a failing Alexa department) causes dissatisfaction with the product and certainly not a claim of a fake or poor device. I guess people like me are not happy with their purchase of Echo devices, thanks to the changes to Prime Music, and Amazon is trying to stop the impact on their Echo devices, but when the two are linked, exactly what do they expect!I wish there was a way to get my money back. My entire family loved Amazon Music, and we purchased numerous Echo products as a result. Many hours of homework spent with the Echo devices as well as the app in the car, at home and school. Our recommendations meant other people purchased Echo products as well. However, the most recent update to Prime Music means a poor imitation of Spotify!I instantly knew there was trouble when Amazon sent a ""marketing"" email in an attempt to convince us that the changes were an improvement to the service when it really is not. My children very quickly uninstalled the Prime Music app (their Echos are now used exclusively as light switches and alarm clocks--just crazy) and now use YouTube Music for playing the music they want to listen to. I have just done the same off all my devices. Amazon claims there is more variety as there is apparently more song content available, but anyone who has enjoyed Prime Music before, instantly notices that a loss in control of content masquerades as a claim of variety.I am now trying to decide between throwing my useless Alexa devices away, or finding someone willing to pay for Unlimited to take the devices off my hands.What no longer works that has caused me to class the Echo devices as useless, even as it now prompts for an upgrade?1. Downloaded songs no longer play on the app2. Can't thumbs down a song3. Can't repeat a song4. Can't skip more than 5 of the songs Amazon forces me to listen to5. Can't play our playlists (starts with the first song, but then switches to playing random, similar music to the first song only and not the songs on the actual playlist. If you request a playlist, the response says, ""playing x playlist and other similar songs."" Cannot play a diverse list of genres, just what is similar to the first song, I mean really, a radio plays more diversity).0 stars for a previous 5 star device because of changes to Prime Music!\n",5 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only
Echo_Dot_3rd_Gen_2018_Charcoal,22.92,15.06,59.98,William F. Nappi,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on September 30, 2019",A Caveat or two awaits you,"\nBe advised hat the more devices you have connectivity to the internet becomes an issue.  I have 4 of these.  When I can stay connected to the internet the Echo Dot is pretty awesome.  Problem right now is that somewhere between the number of smart plugs I have (quite a few, maybe 10) and the number of echo dots (4) I find myself offline, i.e. NOT connected to the internet.  It is ANNOYING to hear the all-to-familiar to me chime, followed by a red halo of light atop Alexa; followed by the also all-to-familiar ""I'm having trouble connecting to the internet.  Check the help section of the Alexa app..."" at which time by now I'm yelling for it to shut up before I can unplug it in order to reboot it in an effort to reconnect to the net.Go to my i-phone to check my network and the scene i the same.  That being a constantly spinning icon trying desperately and taking forever at it to establish a connection to the internet.  The point here is that as I started to say from the beginning the more devices you have the more internet speed is required.  THAT has been my personal experience.I presently have a download speed of only 20Mb.  If all goes well it will be at 4Mb TOMORROW which can't get hee so enough.  I will update this review as soon as I can in case you or anyone else following along here and have the same issue.  If you only have one Echo Dot and maybe 3Smart Plugs 20 Mb download speed should be sufficient.  Finally, so far what I just explained here is not in the Help Section of the Alexa app WHICH incidentally CANNOT  be accessed if you're not connected to the internet.So if you are for example a brainy type or student focused on something and the room begins to lose its light and in an effort to stay focused say 'Alexa, turn on the light,""  you want the light to come on so you can continue on uninterrupted, right?  Good luck with that.  My patience have worn so completely thin from instead of a light coming on but instead hearing the chime; the message etc; they tear easily now. GONE.So hopefully the faster internet speed will remedy my personal nightmare here.  As for the answers to many of the questions asked in the questions section above I'm a little confused because the main issue I have is connectivity issues.  As for giving Alexa different name if they are within earshot of each other:  every now and then I will say; e.g. ""Alexa, turn on the hallway light,"" and Alexa will answer from the other room the she's having trouble connecting to the internet, while the one in the room in which my request originated will turn on the light.To me a lot of all this is pretty intuitive.  If you are the type to have found, let's say earlier versions of MS Windows to be very intuitive your problems will be fewer and you will likely recognize the cause of problems within software apps for the Echo Dot.  I was a lot happier with this before making my house pretty smart and life more convenient WHICH IT WILL BE ONCE I GET THIS F*ING THING TO STAY ONLINE.Again, if you're getting your first one in addition to maybe 3 smart plugs and you have a mere 20Mb download connection you SHOULD be okay and problem free UNTIL you start adding more devices and you most likely will do eventually, little by little or otherwise.  But for starters, like I just said you should be fine with just 1 Echo Dot 3 smart plugs and I will say a minimum 20Mb internet connection.  Me?  Hopefully 40Mb will be enough.  If not, then I will have to go with the max available in my area WHICH is not a whole lot more than 50Mb best I remember Soooooo...Good luck.  It's a cool product and once you are up and running smoothly think 2001 Space Odyssey almost 20 years late.  Seriously.William F. Nappi\n",One person found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

For the basics, it is great.. Turn lights/devices on/off; it's pretty straight forward.. When adding rooms though it can get a bit illogical. Like most, the first time around, one might be inclined to add all the devices in a room to the room in the app. I have old analog radio's and other devices  on simple on/off smart plugs.. Walking into the room and saying ""wake word.. turn on the room""... is jolting when EVERYTHING turns on.. be selective what is added to a 'room' in the app. The naming convention, reminds me of old 90's programming. In this case, like most people, walk into a room and we'd say ""turn on the tv"".. not so.. each tv HAS to have a name even if in a/assigned room.. the same is true for game consoles, bath fans and other items that some families have multiple units of these days.. I can only imagine if there are multiple smart showers/baths!  On occasions my echo's get unassigned from their room, rendering the 'turn on the lights' useless and the drawn out ""there are no devices or groups with the name light or lights"".. When it comes to connection problems Alexa hasn't been taught to be brief, whether it's the 5th time or 500th time You've had a problem it still gives the same long winded response. This week saw AWS 'Amazon Web Services' go down in spectacular fashion for hours.. and the Alexa's responded by indicating it was a problem with the various manufacturers 'skills', and music/books & shipping updates were offline.. The house was completely at Amazon's mercy.. something I imagined could happen but wished never did.. It would be nice if Amazon would make a local mode for at least device control.. Luckily the 3 main manufacturers apps were handy to control the house.  I recently had to reset a echo device because it somehow became unassigned from its room, now absolutely none of my previously connected blutooth speaker will be found or connected to. I really enjoyed sitting on the patio and listening to my Tune In stations.. I can not find any way to get the speakers to connect, nor does any of the echo's find the speakers!  The Alexa web site has seen improvement, though at times it still pushes the Alexa app, but if you have a device that Amazon decides isn't compatible; for instance the app will install on my 7 year old Samsung Galaxy 5, yet my 2 year old tablet with the same basic features as my phone.. won't. The downside to having home AI tech provided by a retailer... they use their platform and tech restrictions to push sales of tablets and phones.  There are some fun things for the Alexa, We have enjoyed the Melissa McCarthy personality voice and they have added some handy weather alerts/notifications lately.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I\u2019ll say \u201cAlexa turn my alarm off\u201d and it just won\u2019t so I have to unplug the entire thing in the morning. Or if my phone is connected I\u2019ll say \u201cAlexa disconnect my phone\u201d and it just won\u2019t do it unless I unplug the entire echo dot. Seeing as half of the draw to Alexa is that you can speak and she listens this feature not working makes the device nearly useless. A wireless speaker would be 10x better seeing as the Alexa features aren\u2019t as refined or helpful as they\u2019re marketed as. If the Alexa actually worked the way it was supposed fo and listened when I said things I would like it but it seems that I either received a faulty one or this brand just sucks and is a huge waste of money\n,3 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

Very disappointed with this. It had great potential, but was a waste of money, since I didn't know about this limit.Original review:  Be careful adding alexa to phone contacts!  I ordered this device for my 88 year old mother so she could call us kids a little easier. It's pretty cool! You can add up to 10 alexa to phone contacts. More would be nice, but 10 was good enough. The problem is, nobody told me that you can only change them once. I added everyone from my phone and then said ""alexa call Jeff"" she said ""do you mean 4ice Jeff?"" Uh oh.... my brother is one of my in-case-of-emergency contacts.  That will confuse my mother. So I edited all of my siblings in my phone so they would make sense to mom. Deleted from the device and started putting them back in. Now I only have 8 contacts and it won't let me put the last two in. It says I've reached my 20 swap limit. I chatted with someone from Amazon and they said there is no work around. So now I'm stuck with a device that has 8 contacts that I probably won't use because of it was for me i would have started with our kids in it. It's no good for mom without all the kids. Good thing that was the $0.99 one! I did order another one but I will be very careful when adding the contacts.\n",2 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

I could play songs from my Amazon Music library playlists for most occasions- which comes in handy when you're watching 3 grandkids. But Amazon changed everything on Amazon music so I will not be buying my 5th Dot for the playroom because. They called it an improvement because they made 100s of more songs available, but if you have specific playlists for things like nap time, it's not an improvement, it's a nightmare. You can't turn shuffle mode off, and Amazon has an AI that thinks it knows which songs you might want to include in your playlist. That would be great if actually did, but just because a song has lyrics like sweet dreams, it doesn't mean that song will lull an 18 year old kid to sleep, or keep them asleep when they are on the verge of nodding out, especially if there are freaking TRUMPETS blaring in the chorus! It's also not nice to lock us into shuffle when you want to set a mood to go to sleep, which is what I do on my Lullabies playlist.

The Echo Dot is a decent speaker. For it's price, I'd even go so far as to call it a good speaker. But if you're like me, you're really buying the Dot so that it can host Alexa and turn your house into a ""smart house."" DON'T BOTHER.Alexa is dumb. Really dumb. And you can't even teach her to be smart, because basic if-then logic is completely beyond her. The programming is entirely set up for ""when"" commands. For example, you can program her to wake you up WHEN it is 6 AM.  But you can't program her to wake you up only IF you are at home. So if you go on vacation, your wake up routine will run, turn on all your lights, raise the thermostat in your house and so on and so forth EVEN THOUGH Alexa knows you're not at home. She knows your location, she'd just not smart enough to use it.Unless you've seen the skill you want to use EXPLICITLY displayed in a commercial, assume that she cannot do it.  Even if you have seen the exact skill you want, you should assume that it will not work as smoothly as shown. You can program a wake up routine, but you can't tell Alexa, ""Run my wake up routine at 6 AM tomorrow instead of 5:30 AM."" No, you have to go in and manually change the programming.  You can't program her to something every other Friday, only every Friday like clockwork or not at all.Here's a short list of things Alexa doesn't do:*Take action only IF something is true. NO if-then functionality at all.*Alter routines*Do tasks on a non-weekly schedule. NO every-other week, no once-a-month, no second-tuesday.*Play music for 30 minutes and then switch off.  Or do anything at all after playing music. Once the Echo Dot starts playing, Alexa is done.*Do a task at a repeated interval (i.e.: Announce the time every 10 minutes)*Play a shuffled playlist as part of a program or routine.*Ask you a question.  Seriously, she can't use any info you give her to take an action. It's dumb.*Regurgitate basic facts you've asked her to remember.*Lock the front door, even when it's a smart lock with an app and everything.Understand, we didn't just roll over and accept defeat.  I'm an engineer. Writing Excel programs is a significant part of my job description. I spend my days beating computers into submission and tricking them into all sorts of things they don't want to do. I was not about to accept that Amazon was dumb enough to put their brand name on a program and interface as monumentally stupid as Alexa was appearing to be. Surely, there was something I was missing. Surely, there was a way to make things work.I started by looking for skills, but didn't really see any that looked like what I wanted. So I went over to skill builder. Still no luck. So I escalated again, and went to the skill builder section intended for large companies. I thought, ""I'm an engineer. I program all day. I can handle it."" Except that apparently, ALEXA can't handle it. Even in the basic, backdoor coding of ""skills,"" available for high-dollar companies trying to build skills for Alexa to use, you can't use conditional statements. No if-then loops. No while loops. Alexa just doesn't function that way.I have depression. I have a roommate with executive dysfunction, one with ADHD and one with Autism. We all pitched in to get the Dot, as well as a bunch of other things to make the house a ""smart house."" Lights, thermostat, plugs, everything. No holds barred.  We were really hoping that Alexa would be able to help us with various basic tasks that we find difficult to manage for one reason or another. We were hoping that this new technology could help make us more functional. We spent all weekend installing the ""easy install"" light switches and thermostat.  We were so excited to get it all programmed and running. In the end, we were monumentally disappointed. The only reason we haven't returned everything is that pulling it all back out of the walls is quite literally more than any of us can handle.I can't believe Amazon has released this product/program and is actively associating their name with it. I can't believe that Alexa has been on the market as long as it has and is still this dumb. If-then statements are the most basic building blocks of programming. How, HOW do you release a program that's intended to be customized, and NOT include basic if-then logic capability?tl;dr - if you want a speaker that will announce the time on command, buy this echo dot. If you want it to make your life easier, give it a pass. At least until Alexa can understand something as simple as ""Alexa, if no one is home, turn off the lights.""\n",One person found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

And you cannot get an answer for resolving half the issues you ask about online or the answers are outdated/wrong.Turning volume up and down is laughable for a \u201chands-free\u201d device. There are basically only two options:1. \u201cturn up/down\u201d and it alters the volume so little you basically can\u2019t even hear the difference, so you have to tell it to do so 4 times before it makes a noticeable difference (if you own an echo, you will know that this is time-consuming as there is a wait time between each command).2. \u201cTurn way up/down\u201d (or some other magnitude modifying word) and it changes it by like 85%3. There is apparently no 3rd option. The 3rd option should be to turn it up/down 25% (or fill in blank), but I have tried this with every thinkable percentage and it clearly doesn\u2019t factor in whatever percentage I tell it. I mean like come on! This should be so basic for a solve-all device that is supposed to be hands-free.Ring Doorbell connection: if you set this up with your Ring doorbell, or similar product, you cannot set a separate volume for it (I\u2019ve tried). So we have had probably 20 occasions in just a couple months where the doorbell was rung and we didn\u2019t even hear it because we had previously turned the volume down to ~20% for listening to background music.Changing rooms. This is more just an example of many smaller nuisances, however this one was infuriating. Someone got us a new 3rd generation echo dot for Christmas, so we wanted to move our old 2nd generation to a different room and relabel it on the app, and put the new one in it\u2019s place. The information online for how to do this was next to nothing, and what little there was was outdated. And I kept getting all these links for changing location (address) when I was searching for how to change rooms. I finally just factory reset it and set it up all over again, but this time in a different room. Also annoying.Im not going to list every single issue, but there are a lot of other things that should totally be intuitive and easy, but they aren\u2019t, or just as likely they are impossible, but you just don\u2019t know it until you\u2019ve tried it ten times. I and I have no idea why this is the case. I love Amazon, and overall the Echo Dot has been a fantastic addition to our home, but Amazon needs to step up their game.

That old echo device could play music but the speaker was terrible so we got a Bose instead.  Then we moved into a bigger place and wanted to listen to music in more rooms and also saw that echo sound quality had improved a lot since my first echo.  so we got this one for my 9yo daughter's room.  She likes to ask it to play songs she heard on the radio or her friends told her about at school.  As a prime subscriber she had access to a small but pretty robust and decent subset of the 'amazon unlimited' music library.  But a recent change in Prime Music has made this unusable.  Every time she requests a song, the echo device plays a long advertisement about why we should subscribe to Amazon Music Unlimited for $9 per month (or $16 for the 'family plan') and then refuses to play the song requested, instead playing something Amazon considers to be a similar song in shuffle mode.  Remember Pandora?  Amazon says the library of songs available in Prime Music is now much larger, but how does that help her when she can't get it to play the one song she wants to hear?Considering how expensive being a ""prime"" member has gotten, I'm now questioning whether it is worth it anymore.as for the device itself- the sound quality is decent considering the size.  the small size is nice- doesn't take up much space.  the ""drop-in"" room-to-room calling feature does not work that well--- it is very hard to hear what the other person is saying unless the rooms are both otherwise silent, but it has saved us a few trips upstairs.  the voice command recognition is pretty good as long as the room is fairly quiet and you speak clearly and a little slower.  the stupid pet tricks can be occasionally useful especially when the room is fairly quiet and your hands are otherwise occupied (dirty, wet, cooking, busy doing something else) otherwise it is easier and faster to just pull out your phone to find what you need.listening to internet radio and using the voice kitchen cooking timer are still its most used features.\n",,Configuration: Device only

Okay...,"\nI was given this device by my apartment management as part of a tech upgrade. It was supposed to allow voice control of my thermostat and door lock (both of which were also replaced as part of the upgrade).The big assumption today, I've noticed, that big companies make is that EVERYBODY has a smartphone.I do not.So, there is no way for me to get these devices to interact. There is no pc app, no website help. No plans for that to ever change.Outside of that, what do I think of the device? Well, it is a fun toy.While the audio is high quality, unless you plug it into a stereo sound system it will always be mono. I understand that if you buy a second one they can cooperate to give you a stereo experience. But I am currently hard-pressed to justify owning one.The instruction leaflet that came in the box seems to be minimalist by design to force you to go online in an effort to find out what sort of things it can do. One of the first things you are encouraged to do is install the app on your phone.I still don't have one of those phones.So I settled for installing Alexa on my pc.  Once you do that, It enables your computer to do everything that the Dot can do, plus you can see what you are doing on a screen. Even less justification for keeping the Dot plugged in.Alexa doesn't always hear what I say correctly. And as the device is capable of making purchases on my verbal command, I do live in fear that it might invisibly sign me up to money-draining services I did not ask for.It does have certain preset ""skills"" that, so far, work. I do, however, have a problem with creating a skill online that I want it to have. It just refuses to do it and offers no explanation as to why not.It is supposed to work with other online services (notably Amazon-owned ones), yet I've noticed it is very picky with allowing me to hear certain radio stations in my TuneIn account, but not others.A big annoyance is not being able to find an easily readable definitive source of info that will tell me, at a glance, everything that the device is currently able to do or can do for a price. The first piece of electronic equipment I've ever owned that forces you to dig like an online gopher for any scrap of data you can get. There are manuals available for purchase. I'm just not convinced that I want to spend a penny more on something I already know or is useless for me to know. I'm not somebody who buys a pig in a poke.Bottom line: It is fun to verbally play with. Beyond that it offers me nothing that isn't better handled by my pc.\n",19 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

But, I was curious to jump into the Alexa ""echosystem.""My journey started with looking for an alarm system as I live alone and occasionally travel for extended periods of time. I chose the Ring system partly because of my perceived better integration with Alexa (since Amazon did buy Ring, afterall).Current Amazon/Ring setup:Ring basic alarm kitRing spotlight battery camRing Doorbell 2Echo Dot (3rd gen)Echo Show 5Fire Tablet 7 (2019)Fire TV 4K (the short box version that was first to offer 4K, whatever generation that is)Pending additions:Ring Peephole cam (prob swapping out the Doorbell 2)Echo FlexHave my eye on:Echo (3rd gen) or Echo PlusEcho subwooferEcho StudioFire TV Cube (2019)As an Alexa point, the Dot does its job. The mic works and Alexa talks through the speaker.The sound quality is terrible for music. Compared to the Show 5, the Dot is slightly better balanced. The highs sound more tinny on the Show 5, and, while there is ever-so-slightly more bass, the Show 5 is ever-so-slightly more muddy than the Dot. In comparison to a JBL Flip 4 or UE Boom 2, the sound of both the Show 5 and Dot is inferior--and that's saying something because I'm quite disappointed with both the Flip and Boom in regards to price/sound quality (I recommend going with a B+O, Klipsch, Bose, etc. if you are looking for better sound in a similar size package--or maybe the UE Megaboom series in a size larger.).The Dot and Show 5 can be added to multiroom music groups through Alexa. This could be of value if one were to connect them to external speakers via the 3.5mm audio out jack on either device. I intend to do just that with an Echo Flex I have on order.If there were some equalization controls, these could be useful for softer, dispersed through-the-house music, but Amazon/Alexa don't seem to offer such features. That specifically is disappointing when using Amazon Music on my phone bluetoothed to my JBL Flip 4s because when I use Apple Music (which includes some equalizer controls), the JBL Flip 4s become somewhat bearable to listen to.I didn't realize how much I would like having a clock, and for that feature the Show 5 is nice. I haven't had a clock in my house except for the stove and microwave in years. For that feature alone though, I'd like to see the Echo Dot Clock come in charcoal or grey, which I would buy over the non-clock Dot.If you are looking for a device for listening to music without additional external speakers, I'd skip the Dot altogether, opting instead for one of the larger Amazon-branded Alexa devices or a reputable speaker brand device that has integrated Alexa functionality. With external speakers, you have a lot of options amongst the Echo devices, and the Dot could be a contender (cheaper with a deal or bundle maybe?) vs the Input, Flex, or Show devices.\n",,Configuration: Device only

Torres,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on February 5, 2020",Mixed Feelings,"\nI purchased 3 dots and 1 show to automate things in my home. I have several products from different manufacturers (Ring, Sengled, Schlage, etc.) and I wanted to combine automation in one place instead of accessing different apps every time I wanted to do something.I found Skills and Routines are hit and miss. Even though the skill is available, or the routine allows you to choose options, they are not really supported by the system. Here is an example:I tried to set up my Foyer lights (Sengled) to go on when motion is detected through the motion detector (Ring). I can select all the options in the Routine and if I ""play"" the routine, the end result (lights go on) work.  However the automation doesn't. When the motion detector senses motion, the routine doesn't trigger.I tested this with other items in my household, and although they work separately, they will not interact with each other.  I called technical support and after the rep seemed like a deer on headlights when assisting me, he said he would have to ""research the issue"" and would call me back in 15 minutes or so. Two days later after not receiving a call back, I called again and this time the rep promptly told me that third party devices do not work with each other in routines as that is not supported right now.....big miss!I know technology is not perfect and companies are always working on further develop their products, however this is to me an essential part of an automation device...integrate all functionality with the services/products you support.I have to add that individual automation of devices works well. For example I have lights  outside my house to turn on at dusk and turn off at dawn, or my living room lights to turn off at a certain time of the night.Another issue we have is the communication between devices. I ""drop in"" some times to ask my wife or mother in law questions and 90% of the time the drop-in communication is muffled and they can not understand a word I am saying. It also happens when they initiate communication.  Music sounds pretty good out of the echo devices so I don't think is a speaker issue, and voice commands are recognized no problem so I don't believe is a mic issue either. My WiFi connectivity usually clocks at around 270Mbps so I know it is not my connection.Finally, skills. I created a skill from scratch that would give me a countdown for a trip we will be taking. The skill works great when I interact with Alexa directly. However, once again, Routines leave a lot to be desired. The skill does not even show in my skill list when creating the routine. This doesn't make the feature of skills pointless but once again, the ""automation"" part leaves a lot to be desired.I may edit my review if/when all these functions are implemented, but for the time being I think this product has quite a bit of ""room to grow"".\n",,Configuration: Device only

Schulze-clewing,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on June 26, 2022",You cannot call the registered cell phone with it,"\nFirst the good part. The audio quality is absolutely excellent for such a small device. The hardware seems great and of sturdy quality. Nice.The cloud service is where the problems start. A cell number with texting capability is required to register the service. Afterwards the caller ID for Alexa is fixed to that phone number. With many if not most carriers this means that calls from Alexa to that same cell phone number (your cell phone) are refused or, like in my case, go straight to voice mail no matter what. I had a discussion with an Amazon rep about it and there is no solution to that problem. This needs to be fixed and the fix is easy. Allow email verification instead of text message. Then any land line can also be used. Or allow the ID to be changed to the land line later (after email verification, if needed). If the name and address registered for the land line are the same as for the cell phone, that should be straightforward.There are some other shortcomings. For example, it seems to be impossible to do a ""whole house"" drop in on a group without speaking the command to drop in on ""all devices"" into Alexa. No dice via the communicate function in the Alexa app. This is not feasible if you have to quietly drop in to check on a disabled relative, a baby or a pet without disturbing everyone around you.\n",,Configuration: Device only

Unfortunately i was entirely unimpressed with both.After setting up my dot, and linking it to the smart bulbs in my living room, i tried seeing what Alexa could do. Turns out, not much. Not only did it not understand the sample commands printed in the scant instruction book or Alexa app like ""Alexa, set lights to Green"", when it DID decide to actually do something, it would only control ONE bulb at a time.""OK"" I thought ""Lets see how it handles my new Music Unlimited sub."" Again, VERY poorly. There were a few albums worth of music already in the account, added automatically based on CDs i had ordered in the past (very nice feature BTW) so i asked Alexa to play some specific songs. Pretty much every single attempt was a complete dud. So next i tried getting Alexa to play my favorite podcast. Again, near complete failure. It took the dot multiple attempts to figure out i was asking for a podcast, and NOT a song with a similar title, despite me adding the word ""podcast"" in first at the beginning, then the end, and once, not at all. 4th time was the charm apparently, and i finally manged to get Alexa to play the podcast i wanted. Turns out though, that you can't request a specific episode, or episode title.Finally, i decided to try setting up a routine, something simple. I set up a hypothetical morning wake up routine, where Alexa would turn on my lights and ramp the brightness up to 100% over 5 minutes (something basic, front and center in the menu), and noticed that for some reason you couldn't set a color this way. Okay, white it is i guess. I also wanted Alexa to play a song as well. Well, turns out there's no option to ramp the volume on a song up, at least not in a normal way that i could see. So instead of setting up ONE routine that started about 5 minutes before i got up, and slowly increased in intensity, i had to make TWO routines. One for lights, and a second for the music 5 minutes later.I turned off my smart lights (not via switch, but via app, gotta have actual power to the things for them to work after all) and waited for the routine to kick in. At the appointed time when my living room lights were supposed to come on, imagine my surprise when only ONE light comes on. About 45 seconds later the second light finally comes on. BOTH lights are at around 75% brightness. Now, silly me i had assumed that the lights would start at basically off and go from there, gradually. Nope, almost fully bright, then every minute or so ONE bulb would suddenly click a few degrees brighter, followed by the other 30-40 seconds later.It's at this point i should mention that you cant set an entire room's worth of lights to do anything other than be on or off. So i couldn't just, say, have my entire Living Room group turn the lights on, then ramp up. No, that would be too useful. INSTEAD, you have to set each device INDIVIDUALLY. So i had to set the turn on at a set time, then ramp up in brightness over a period of time for one bulb, then do the same for the other.When it was time for the music to kick in, it decided ""Screw it, who cares if you set it to play from the Echo Dot. Let's play from the phone instead."" Literally every step of a very simple routine was an absolute failure.For being on the 3rd generation of Echo Dot the thing is pretty much like a beta-test product. The Alexa app is borderline useless, integrates poorly with the Echo Dot, and functions erratically when it DOES decide to try working.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I decided to update both Echo's and add to my household for more quality and help from Alexa.  I had noticed that the speaker of 1st generation dot was starting to sound a bit off, like a cracked speaker, and Alexa wasn't responding as well as before (but she heard me better than this new one), hence the update of the dot.  And the upgrade for the original Echo 2nd Generation was because of the Zigbee hub (I updated to Echo Plus 2nd Gen).  That all being said...The Echo 3rd Generation Dot in the kitchen doesn't hear me very well (the old one did a better job).  Many times I will ask Alexa to add things to my shopping list and she gets it totally wrong or I hear the new Echo Plus 2nd Generation in the other room pick it up.  Also if I tell her to set a timer in the kitchen, again many times she doesn't hear me or the other one will pick it up.  I figure the reason the other Echo (in another room) hears me is because I am having to shout at Alexa to do what I am asking; set a 10 min timer, add eggs to the shopping list, ect.  Very annoying!Not to be all negative on the 3rd Generation, if I do play music on the Everywhere Group setting it isn't to bad sounding, but it is in my kitchen (my hub) and I need to be able to request to her to add things to the shopping list, set timers and she needs to be able to hear it correctly and not make me shout at her.Lastly, the Echo Dot 3rd Generation sound quality (when she does hear you) is way off.  I have tried repeatedly to bring up the sound quality (less base / muffled sound) for use in just the kitchen.  The Echo Dot 3rd Generation is way to muffled sounding, and sadly this one is going somewhere in the household where it will be rarely used and I will bring the old one back out of retirement...at least I could understand the Echo 1st Generation more, with no muffled sound, and she heard me way better than the Echo 3rd Generation.  I am disappointed in this Echo 3rd Gen Dot and glad it was on sale, per it wasn't worth the 50.00 original asking price.  I do enjoy the Echo Plus 2nd Generation with the Zigbee Hub, but it is in a different room, and I do play music through it.\n",,Configuration: Device only

Every night at 2:54am it does a little beep which I can't make it stop. Many times it has issues connecting to wifi and I have to reboot it (I have learned to hate the overly long ""I am not connected to the internet"" message it says). And most of all, it is constantly ""by the way, did you know about....""ing me on various features I could use when I just want it to shut up.But I haven't replaced it yet for one big reason, I have bought a decent amount of songs on amazons music store and sometimes I like to listen to them while I do stuff around my home. Unfortunately, amazon has now made it to where the echo dot can no longer play the songs I own without randomly shuffling in other music. I would have to pay a $9 monthly fee to unlock the ability to loop a song I've purchased or play a playlist of songs that I own.

At first. Then lost the connection and in spite of having it discover devices and finding it, it then failed to communicate. Many attempts of that and it finally worked again. And if can of course just select base colours, the moods the Hue has in the app won\u2019t work. So functionality with the Hue smart lights is somewhat limited, the AI of the Echo isn\u2019t good enough.SpotifyAttempt 1. Holy s**t, what a mess! I have a playlist on my Spotify. I use that because you can add whole albums to it, so it is the normal way to do it. Also I can pick different playlists for different purposes. Of course just the way a music service having playlists is supposed to work. But with the Echo it failed 100 %. When I asked it to play my playlist it either played some raining song (far from my kind of music too) or some Spotify radio station. If I asked it to play Suppers ready with Genesis it played \u201cGenesis radio on Spotify\u201d. If I asked it to play my liked songs it played, yes you guess correctly, something random that I do not like. After a while it started to play \u201cdaily mix one\u201d. Hmmm\u2026..Attempt 2. I unlinked and relinked the Spotify account and after that it works better. But not as it should. I can now actually get it to play the song I ask it to or the artist I ask for. That\u2019s an improvement. But my playlist, nope won\u2019t work. If I ask it \u201cAlexa, play my playlist One\u201d it tells me \u201cPlaying your liked songs\u201d. And it does play my liked songs. Only thing, to get my music there I have to add every single song manually, which is quite a lot. And of course I can only have one library liked songs, I can\u2019t use different playlists.So that\u2019s where I stand now. It works, but only to play Liked songs. Using a playlist seems to be impossible for me, and that is in my opinion a severe functionality problem. I think for a Spotify user Google Home is a better alternative since google Assist seems to work better with Spotify.Maybe using Amazon Music works better and Amazon makes the functionality with Spotify inadequate on purpose. But for me Amazon Music is not an option. And if there is an alternative for Spotify on the device, you\u2019d think it should be able to play playlists.All in all these things lower the grade quite a lot.\n",,Configuration: Device only

Mostly dots, but I have a couple of shows as well.  For a long time all was well.  I kept adding to my network.  I have almost every light switch in my house moved to a smart switch.  I can open and close my curtains through alexa, and I have enjoyed using it as an intercom to the kids rooms using the drop in feature.  But recently, she has been getting stupid.Issue 1: Recently, I tried to drop in on my son, by saying, ""Alexa, drop in on [NAME]"".  This has always worked in the past.  Lately, at least half the time, she asks me, ""Do you mean [son's name/daughter's name]?  And I say no.  And she asks me who do I want to drop in on.  I tell her, and she is stuck asking me if i mean something else.  Now, the only think I can think of is that she has access to my phone's address book since my son has my daughter's old phone number.  What the heck?!?!  And Amazon doesn't seem to monitor their own help forums to even provide help.  So scratch that one off the nice feature list.Issue 2:  Forgets some skills, and seems to install others I don't want.  I am using a pretty obscure wifi enable controller to open and close some large curtains.  It worked for over a year.  Then one day, it just stopped working through alexa.  Still works through the manufacturer supplied app.  I looked in my skills, and the skill for that device is just gone.  All of my routines are still there, and refer to the skill in the settings, but the skill isn't there and when I redownload, I can't sync to the original account.  So scratch that off the nice features list.Issue 3:  The most basic smart home control:  Light switches.  I have two rooms that she has become stupid about.  The garage and the study.  I have always been able to say, ""Alexa, turn on/off the garage/study lights.""  And she has done it perfectly until now.  Now most of the time, she responds, ""The garage/study doesn't support that.""  What the heck?  So scratch that off the nice features list.If all you want to do is ask what the temperature is, then go ahead an buy an echo device.  Otherwise, I would say that this is giving amazon a huge black eye.  There are so many similar questions as mine on line, and even on the alexa page right here on amazon.  But amazon doesn't answer the question.

Also, i hoped to use the pair for a music alarm, but th function is even less useful for this activity. After searching for pleasing music for waking, i asked Alexa to play the music. Two out of five attempts are successful. Amazon has not invested in a well developed search engine. Even when i established that a certain album is available in my Amazon music account, Alexa can not find it. Occasionally, i find something that Alexa can also find.

I bought 3 of these and all three only lasted about a year until it started having major problems. The speaker got very static-y, when I would set a timer with it, I couldn\u2019t add any more time to it but it wouldn\u2019t tell me that. It would just ring at the initial timer amount set, so needless to say, I had a lot of uncooked meals. And,  It wouldn\u2019t understand a lot of my simple inquiries that I\u2019d asked before with no problem. So if you don\u2019t mind replacing it annually, then it\u2019s a handy thing to have. The speaker on it is pretty weak though. It\u2019s better if you can hook up an external speaker to it.My least favorite thing about this Echo Dot is that the ideal volume for me doesn\u2019t exist..ex: level 4 is too soft and level 5 is way too loud. Oh, and there\u2019s too much bass in the voice and not enough treble so it\u2019s hard to understand unless you\u2019re right close to it. The microphone does have pretty good range though. Sorry that I didn\u2019t measure how far, but I can\u2019t do it now bcz they don\u2019t work as well as they used to.My favorite thing about it is that you can configure it in Settings to not shut down after it answers your question so you can keep talking to it. I like this bcz it\u2019s habit for me to say thank you after somebody answers my question and when it turns off and I say thank you I\u2019m talking to dead air so when it hangs around it actually says you\u2019re welcome or other things that appreciate you.Wow, am I needy!\n",10 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

(This shocked me, and I believe it is a significant flaw that should be addressed in future releases.)It doesn't appear to have any logic circuitry, instead relying on a massive database of references and some basic cross-referencing to find and retrieve data with the Alexa integration.

I wasn\u2019t disappointed, but I also won\u2019t say my expectations were met. My biggest problems with Alexa is how often she turns on or interrupts when she was never called upon. I can be watching a movie or a YouTube video and she turns on and says something. A lot of times I\u2019m alone and in my bed and that\u2019s very scary, but that\u2019s not the worst of it.

My phone can tell me the weather, and light switches and manual locks have worked fine so far.  I got this because I like listening to music or videos while I cook, clean, and work on the computer at my table.  So basically I'm in it for a bluetooth speaker.  And I have to say, it's kind of neat to have a bluetooth speaker that accepts voice commands.  The problem is in how it responds to those voice commands.Me: ""Alexa, set the volume to fifty percent.""Alexa: ""Sorry, you can only set the volume between zero and ten.""Me: ""Alexa, what is fifty percent of ten?""Alexa: ""Fifty percent of ten is five.""This is the problem I've had with every voice assistant I've encountered so far.  You can't speak to them in everyday language using simple concepts that a computer should be able to understand.  Alexa should be smart enough to know that fifty percent is the same as five out of ten.  If you can't give the device simple, direct commands and have those commands be understood, then why have voice control?As far as a speaker goes, this is about what you would expect from a bluetooth speaker of this size.  You're not going to get clear and sparkling highs, but the overall sound is strong and there's the perfect amount of bass response if like me you enjoy music but also live in close quarters and aren't trying to disturb the neighbors.5 stars for Voice recognition - It knows what I'm saying.2 stars for Alexa integration - The device understands my words, but it doesn't know what they mean or act on them.4 stars for Sound quality - I hoped for a bit more clarity, but this is perfectly adequate for a speaker of this size and cost.\n",One person found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

I've had devices for a few years controlling lights and outlets and can finally say I'm ready to remove all of it from my home. Voice recognition is poor. Amazon is increasing the number of advertisements it pushes to you through these devices while decreasing functionality. For example, not long ago I could request Alexa to restart a song if her voice covered up the beginning (that happens often). Now apparently you have to pay for that simple feature. If you just can't resist, I recommend only getting one device. Place it in a central location in your home and only allow it to control a very limited number of lights or plugs. The more you add to the system, the more potential for frustration you will find. Just today we had a very brief power outtage. Now about half of the devices in my home will not reconnect to the system in spite of rebooting them and following all recommended procedures.

Short version: it doesn't work, so avoid if that's your intention.---About Home Theater---We have a Fire Stick that the app will see as available to use for Home Theater, but when I try to select this new 3rd Gen Dot it is greyed out and says it is incompatible. I also have another Stick on the same network that isn't that old, but it isn't even an option to try pairing anything to.  I'm so tired of Amazon's ""ecosystem"" of devices working so incredibly poorly with one another.Their Connect voice quality sucks, this feature sucks, the compatibility between generations for something as seemingly simple as playing an audio stream from FireTV on your Dot? Sucks. I'm not sure why they can't get it working on older devices, but that's annoying. What's more annoying is when you buy a product specifically for the task, which Amazon says should work, only to find it doesn't.---Sound Quality---These 3rd Gen dots still sound really quite poor - if you want to listen to music, you'll still have to output them to a dedicated speaker or suffer weak, muddy sound that lacks both clarity and depth. When you compare to something like a $15ish Logitech X50 bluetooth speaker, I have no idea how this thing can be AC powered and still sound so crappy in comparison. It's better than the earlier gens, but that isn't hard to do as the sound quality was quite possibly the worst sound I'd ever heard.---Conclusion---Ultimately, I'm done trying. I'll find another way. The features compared to Google Assistant based speakers are entirely lacking, and the sound quality still isn't good enough. Glad I got this Dot on the cheap because it allowed me to learn not to invest in Amazon devices like this anymore. Each generation ends up siloed from previous ones so you'd have to buy newer ones for simple additions, and even then they don't even work!Disappointing.\n",,Configuration: Device only

When Echo works, it can be quite convenient.  The set up process for each device is a bit of a pain as every manufacturer is a little different and wants you to use their app.  That wouldn't be so bad, but be aware, my experience is that I have to re-set up my devides every month.  Not the same ones mind you.  Sometimes it is the Gosund plugs, then the Sengled lights, or Cync, or another one I forget now.  In retrospect, buying all the exact same manufacturer plugs and lights would likely help, but in theory, all this is supposed to be easy, and it is...until I go through my monthly or more often re-setup.  And, don't forget that if your internet goes down, Echo shuts down also  One would think that would only disable the info features, but nope, Alexa does nothing if she can't talk to the internet.  All your convenience disappears.  The intercom aspect is handy, and overall, I like the features and use Alexa daily.  I also end up cursing Alexa almost daily when I am fighting with it to understand a phrase, repeating myself, doing re-setups, etc.  At some point, a lot of this will likely be worked out.  Just be aware we are not there yet and you should be tech-friendly, as I am, or I imagine this will be nightmarishly difficult.\n",,Configuration: Device only

For my hue lights I like  motion detectors also Philips Hue Smart Dimming Kit.Once you set up your home with motion detectors and door sensors. Like for example opening my closet door the light automatically comes on or when we walk into the bathroom the lights automatically come on because the motion sensor turns them on.  After having these automations with motion detectors and door sensors voice seems kind of an extra step that is not even needed.I do think the best thing that I have found to use the echo and Google hub  devices for is in the kitchen to set timers for when your hands are not able to touch a screen.  Also setting alarms are pretty easy and very reliable.

I received 2 for the price of 1 and got 2 smart bulbs as well, during their \u201cearly Black Friday deals\u201d. Let me start by saying I wanted this for 2 reasons and it disappointed on both. 1)To make calls for work to the carriers (most require to push \u201cx\u201d to get to the correct area and this won\u2019t do that :( ) it works for the carriers I don\u2019t have to select a choice or to call my account reps ect. Sound quality is spot on and it does a great job on listening in on meetings ect to take notes so I trade one for the other. 2) to use to listen to music and pod casts as I work or sleep. If Alexa would pick a better variety then this would be perfect. But example: I say Alexa play 80\u2019s music and it chooses the exact same station that plays the exact same songs over and over. If I say \u201cCountry Love Songs\u201d it plays the Country Love category on my IPhone gahhh.

It will play ambient music in the Amazon music service for about 15 minutes and stop, even if asked to play 8 hours.

I had thought it would access the internet in general, but it apparently can only access Amazon owned or licensed audio files and services. It apparently does not understand requests longer than five or six words. There does not appear to be a way to access incremental sound volume control. There is no explanation of the four buttons on top. It seems to have some access to a general information service that can give you short answers to general information requests. Good to hear general headline news and weather in the morning. It has a bit of weight and feels sturdy. It's about the size and weight of a hockey puck.

This would have been a deal-breaker had I known it going in.There is little to no management of individual devices.The trigger words are often misheard in general conversation, leading to general nonsense.Downs (Minor):Connectivity is an occasional issue, often requiring a manual reboot.(Amazon, if you are listening and tell me to check my network, I will tell you to sit in the corner.)Voice Recognition is functional, but you must know how to address it.The rules:  #1 - Background conversation must not be happening. This includes radio or TV. Volume does not matter.  #2 - Background noise must be as minimal as possible.  #3 - Speak the trigger word, then wait a second before the command. A 2-count is fine.  #4 - Enunciate with exaggeration! Monotone will not pass with Amazon. Use that stage voice!  #5 - Do not pause while speaking the command.Whisper mode is a lie.Amazon knows very little about pricing and information about Amazon services.

I thought it would be better, being the third gen. I'll start with the issues with it, and then go on to what I like.I have been using it with Spotify, as well as a speaker for my computer. For Spotify, numerous times it has just not done what I told it. Its playing a playlist, I say ""Play %s from Spotify"", where %s is whatever, does not actually matter. It says Sure playing *whatever said* and then the music pauses for a brief second, and goes back to playing whatever it was playing before, with no change. The device heard me, recognized what I said, acknowledged it was requested to do it, and then did nothing. I would try numerous times in a row, and it would still not do as it was meant to (Again this is a software issue). Next, using it as a speaker. Numerous times it just stops playing sound. I change my speaker back to the built in sound on my laptop, and sound comes out, switch it back to the echo, and nothing. My laptop has no issue having sound come out, and the music is playing, the echo just refuses to output it. I have restarted the laptop, and messed around with the sound settings nothing changes it. I've changed what app the sound is coming out of, still nothing. The solution I've found, is unplugging the echo and plugging it back in, but I could have to do this even up to 3 times an hour. To me, that proves the issue is the echo, not the laptop. Of course, the issue is not always present.So onto the good. The devices voice recognition is honestly not bad, but I would say if you have an accent, lisp, or mumble, it will have lots of issues. Now that may improve with time, but that I cannot speak to. The set up is easy, all it requires is the mobile app, or I believe it can be accessed via a web page. Their is many features/apps one can install so it may interact (aka Spotify). It does not need to be connected to ones phone to work, which is nice. It has a button to turn off the mic, so it will no longer listen/record. I quite like that, but I cannot speak to whether it actually does stop listening and recording, I'd almost be willing to bet it doesn't, but idk.I got it with the special deal with amazon music unlimited, so I spent almost $10 all in all (one month music included). For that price it may be worth it, but I would absolutely not pay 40/50+ for this, especially with all the issues. As a whole not happy with the device so far. If anything changes, I will update this review to reflect.I will say, their customer service is absolutely wonderful.

I'll bet there are others out there who have different schedules thruout the week that will find it a pain also.  Or is my situation unique?  Having to set up an individual repeating alarm (or whatever) for Mon, then another one for the same time Tues, then another one for the same time Thurs, then another one for  the same time Fri and then still another different one for a different time on Weds is, ahem, less than ideal.

Soooo why 2 stars?  Well, despite all these neat things they can do, that is their job.  That\u2019s why I have over $500 invested into this system.  Ya, that\u2019s a good price for what I have but that\u2019s if these things worked correctly all the time.  Thing is, they only work right about 50% of the time.  Using Alexa is terrible.  It\u2019s the biggest flaw.  It just doesn\u2019t hear things right and if it were human, I would say it is one of the most stubborn people I know.  I am constantly repeating commands multiple times.  Sometimes I will be right in front of one talking in a bedroom and you get a response from one two rooms over.  It is an issue with alarms because you don\u2019t want a kitchen alarm going off in someone\u2019s bedroom, etc.  the other issue is audio drop-outs.  I will just randomly lose audio in different rooms.  Even right next to the router while other things are streaming.  Then it gets stubborn and won\u2019t comeback until you go into another room and tell it to start up again in the room you want.  If you don\u2019t, it will keep telling you it\u2019s playing what you requested but just goes silent.  Tech support is a joke.  Protocol for everything is (turn everything off, router, modem, firesticks, echos and restart.  Ok, I do that and most of the time it fixes it but when these things happen again and again and again.  Spending 30 minutes doing that is not a solution.  They just need to make a better product.  Anyways, I\u2019ve seen plenty of people say \u201coh I have no problems\u201d. Ok good for you, and if you only have one echo dot, ya, you probably won\u2019t see as many issues.  I\u2019m just saying, I\u2019ve had 100\u2019s and 100\u2019s of tech devises and these (though they can do some neat things) are way too problematic to be satisfied with.  If I could do it over, I\u2019d have gone with Google products for my smart home.\n",,Configuration: Device only

Initial set-up was fairly easy, almost intuitive. Voice recognition is very good. The smart devices were another matter. I spent almost an hour trying to get my first bulb working only to discover that it was bad. Switched bulbs and the second worked just fine.

So either Amazon is either deliberately messing with the program so people purchase the upgrade or something is wrong with my device.

Or have they simply been having problems with this for over a month now that they just can't seem to figure out? You take your pick. My ten-year-old could code better.

It has no connectivity issues, WTF.- Apple: An advertisement that plays every other commercial break where the people say ""Alexa"" that activates mine so it can tell me to DL the ap every 15-minutes...somewhere an advertisement executive needs to be shot.Oh, and one more thing...- I reached the point where I honestly could turn off my alarm to wakeup and still be asleep. No, seriously. I am conscious just enough to find the snooze button but not to become awake. So IO figured ""Hey, why not get an Alexa? I can set and cancel alarms much easier, it confirms them, and in my dream state I cannot speak 'alexa' and I need to be awake to recognize the source, so it will guarantee I wake up.""

First, the good things.  Installed easily and unobtrusive on the counter.  Can speak to it in a regular voice and it seems to understand both my wife and me without problems.  Able to create lists for various shopping trips, if we can go, without problems.  Able to stream SiriusXM with stations selected on command, as well as Pandora and Spotify.But ....  the sound quality of the Alexa voice is muddy, and sometimes hard to understand.  I boosted the treble and lowered the bass in the equalizer, did not seem to make much difference.  Not clear that mine is defective, as many others seem to have the same problem.  Although it can interface with a Roku, the commands are quite limited; it can run a Roku application, but not control it once loaded, so you still need the remote.  Seeking information, Alexa is often beaten by Google.  For example, I wanted to know when the local NFL team was playing, it was able to give me the time of the game.  But when I asked for the network broadcasting the game, ""I don't have that information"" was the response.  Google Assistant came through with the correct information.  This has happened with other searches as well.  Disappointing.So, overall, Alexa is good, but not great.  Music played through the speaker is acceptable, but not the Alexa voice.

Unlike many others, I am using the echo environment in parallel with the Google assistant. The main reason of doing so comes from the compatibility issues and what these devices are programmed to cover. Yes, there are many similarities that you can get from both but if you are really into the smart assistant devices then you realize that the differences are remarkable and I wanted to have everything covered and connected so I am using both (Amazon echo and Google assistant). For obvious reasons, way bigger than what I can even encounter in here, Google is dominating the market when it comes to the speed and ease of use smart assistants and Alexa which is still quite better than Siri, Cortana and Bixby are still way far from Google on the second place. A great example of the differences here is like,when you are talking to an adult person vs you are talking to a kid! So with an adult you can speak freely and expect to get a response most likely than you are talking to a kid. I personally can't blame Amazon for what Google has been dominating solely for years and years ahead of everyone else so if you learned how to speak with this kid (Alexa in here), she is going to get the job done accurately and there's more, as I mentioned on the very beginning. It comes from the area of what one particular device covers and it's that important to get your attention to have the more compatible smart assistant for the tasks or other services you are planning to use. The bottom line here is the third generation of echo dot devices are the best of it's own kind and having them in parallel with Google assistant will do almost everything for what is doable in 2019 technology relm.\n",,Configuration: Device only

One set up to wi-if no problem and has worked great since. The second one, I had to try several times to connect, before I was successful. But it did not stay connected and all I could get out of it was a "" I'm having difficulties at this time, please try later"" response. At times it would just start talking without even being prompted.Then it might work for a week or so before it wouldn't do anything. I reached out to customer service via chat. That chat lasted over thirty  minutes only to be "" disconnected "" before problem resolved.  Again I reconnected going thru all the steps.  Week later it didn't stay connected, so I called and talked to a "" electronic specialist "".  That call was over half an hour long. I tried requesting a return shipping label, so I could send it back and get a new replacement since it was a faulty device. I was told that is not an option. I would have to send it back and they would fix it.  I responded that I bought a new item and want a new one as a replacement, not a ""FIXED ITEM ""  He finally agreed to send out a NEW echo dot and I would have to return the original.  A few days later, I received a ""REFURBISHED"" echo dot 3.  When I called to speak to a  supervisor, I was told that it is their policy to send refurbished ones if a new one is not in ""their stock"".  Doesn't matter they have new ones to sell on the website. I told him that I don't except that and it was not what I paid for. And if they are sending out refurbished echos, there must be a huge problem with them. He advised that they test them and to try it out.  So I opened the box.  All that was in the box was the echo dot. No power source .  Again 4th time reaching out to a Tech specialist- supervisor and 45 minutes of phone time. I was told that they only send device out when replacing. And they don't send out any accessories. When was a plug considered an accessory when it is needed to use device.  Again I told him that I bought a new device and it was faulty and I wanted a new device as a replacement.  Not one that has been fixed.  Also I found out that the 90 day warranty did not begin again when the replacement device gets registered. They back date it to the original sell date of first device.  So I only had 40 days left on the warranty.  Also if you go on line , a refurbished echo goes for $29.99, compared to the $ 49.00 , for a new one. Not once did any representative say that I would be refunded the $20.00 difference for the refurbished echo dot. I told him that this is an AMAZON echo dot. It has their name on the product and they should stand behind their name. I also said if I were to buy a tv from a store and took it home and it quit working, they would replace it with a new tv, not a refurbished one. I will never buy another electronic device that AMAZON sells with their name on it. I will tell all my friends and family that they will get screwed if something goes wrong with their product.

""Alexa, please please do what I asked.""""Okay, doing something else completely different.""""Alexa, stop!"" ""Ok google, do this for me.""""Ok, done.""That's about the usual interaction with Alexa. Its voice recognition is BAD, and only correctly understands probably about two-thirds of the time. The other third of the time, it's really bad. If you're lucky, it will decide to define random words or play some random song instead of turning lights off or making a new reminder.  This is for native English speakers who lived in North America for life, probably speaking closest to their basic training data as possible; I can't imagine how it would understand a non-native English speaker or with non-American accents.Do I recommend it? Well, I half recommend it. When it works, it's quite useful, and has pretty good integration, but that's only when it works. You really have to jump through structural hoops and do it in exactly the right structure when asking for things (always always put ""am"" or ""pm"" on you time when setting alarms or reminders, since it likes to set these for the middle of the night), which can be very awkward and unnatural.The design of the companion app keeps changing and still doesn't seem to have a UX expert assigned to it, so it's horrible to navigate through (Google Home app is even worse though, so there's that). I use the reminders feature extensively to help the kids keep track of when to join online school meetings, but I have to go into the app several times a week to fix or create reminders that the voice interface can't do properly.Good: nice access to music and Amazon services (at least with Prime), good integration with wide variety of smart home servicesBad: bad voice recognition and intention understanding, clunky and rigid interface to access some features (you have to phrase it just-right), poor knowledge lookup results (i.e., web search)Comparison to Google Home: I've been using both for years. Echo/Alexa and Google Home are similar on the outside, but have very different (and opposite) strengths and weaknesses. Echo/Alexa are strong on music, Amazon services, and smart-home integration, while Google Home is strong on voice recognition and knowledge search (Google recently killed their good music offering) and ok on Google service integration. When they're on sale they're cheap enough to get both and use them for different things.Bottom line: Alexa raises your blood pressure when you interact with it because Alexa often doesn't understand, in comparison Google Home nearly always understands and does better search but has inferior integrations. Alexa with Google-quality voice recognition would be great, but it's nowhere near that.\n",,Configuration: Device only

Even after training it.However, as this was to be used for Amazon Music and podcasts, it is beyond useless. Voice recognition doesn't recognize artists names or track titles. After several retries you are better off just going to the Amazon Music app.But, and here is where the issue is, the Amazon Music app and Alexa app are garbage. Absolutely terrible. Amazon Music somehow has screen refresh issues. It fails to load the screen, or goes into some dizzying refresh cycle where it loads over and over and over. That or it just displays a black screen.If you are lucky enough to actually find a track or artist you want to play, then hit the play buttonn, there is a rediculously long delay on the order of 5-10 seconds where it thinks about doing it.And then the buffering, oh the buffering. It appears they don't use one. It repeatedly skips and pauses, even on a a 280Mbs WIFI signal and 4G cell service. Its useless.And then, it will crash on you.And for the Alexa app, it crashes repeatedly. I have to click the ""close app"" button when Android indicates it has crashed in the background. This occurs roughly 4-5x per day.So, here I am with a device that seems capable, but the applications to use with it are garbage. What an ecosystem! Way to go Amazon. Hire some real developers please.I canceled my music subscription immediately. There's $10 wasted. Now I have a device that I was hoping to use for music and podcasts, and now I can't.Avoid if you plan on using this for music streaming.\n",,Configuration: Device only

If I factory reset the device it works, but then I will ask it something like ""remind me in 30 minutes to eat"" and it will say ""reminders are currently not supported on this device"". If I ask it again it will repeat this, but then after a few tries it will say ""okay, I'll remind you in 30 minutes"". The last reply used to be the only reply it gave when it was still working, but these forced updates broke my Echo Dot and now it doesn't work.The other problem is that if I unplug it or the power goes out, and then power is restored instead of just reconnecting to my network like it used to it gives me this rotating orange light and won't respond at all. If I push the action button it says \u201cUpdating your device. I\u2019ll let you know when it\u2019s ready.\u201dFactory resetting is the only way to fix this, but then the same problems I described start happening again; \u201creminders not supported\u201d, and then \u201cupdating your device\u201d.This started around the time the update was pushed to this device. The fact that it\u2019s not working is a consequence of something from Amazon\u2019s end and not my end. If this cannot be fixed I would like the device exchanged for a working Echo Dot.Amazon literally broke this device's functionality. Until this recent issue My Echo worked well enough for the small number of tasks I used it for. I will try reaching out to them again to see if they are willing to replace what they broke through their OTA updating policy (which their CS told me they cannot roll back despite the problems it has caused). I hope they will be willing to do this, and be more careful about what they are doing with these device updates in the future.When it works it's nifty, but Amazon can make it stop working, and that is a serious design flaw.\n",54 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

The setup was very easy and Alexa seamlessly integrated with my network, she seems to work well, and I was able to even integrate my Sonos speakers with the network, which is nice.  I now have music in every room in the house.  The problems are:1) There is no full functionality of third-party music services with Alexa.  Have Apple Music and Spotify and Pandora accounts...Apple Music is a paid service, too...but despite having Apple Music set as the default music service in Alexa, she continues to default to Amazon music.  She also refuses to shuffle playlists from any of the music services that allow you to build your own playlists (Spotify and Apple).  You set her to shuffle mode and it just continues to play the playlist in order...and she won\u2019t load the whole playlist...she only plays about the first 15 songs on a loop.  So, while she works okay, there is still a lot missing with full functionality of third party music services.2) Playing music from the Echo speakers requires separate commands for each room, or she\u2019ll just play on all speakers.3) She won\u2019t play the same music on both the Echo speakers and the Sonos speakers...while they are linked in that Alexa will control the Sonos speakers, she will not play the same music on all the speakers.  She requires separate commands for both Sonos and Echo speakers.So, while we are enjoying the benefits of having the speakers, and there are many, I really wish the developers would get to the bottom of these third party music service integration issues.\n",,Configuration: Device only

The experience has been mixed. The Dot paired with my laptop easily and the sound quality was definitely better than the laptop speakers; however, despite the fact that the Dot sits right next to the laptop, the Bluetooth connection is not stable, occasionally disconnecting and reconnecting for no discernible reason (and loudly announcing itself when it reconnects during a meeting).  I thought an easy fix would be to connect the Dot to the headphone jack of the laptop using a 3.5mm cable, but discovered to my dismay that the 3.5mm jack on the back of the Dot is an output only, not an aux input.  In other words, you can use the Dot to play music on external speakers, but you cannot play audio from an external source on the Dot.  To get a jack which handles both output AND input, you need to buy one of the more expensive Echo devices (e.g., the $100 Echo Gen 4 or the $200 Echo Studio).  No thanks.  For the huge price difference, I will make do with the annoyance of the occasion Bluetooth connection problems.\n",,Configuration: Device only

It's a decent speaker with good, clear sound. Where it falls short is where you need it most. 1) Alexa's voice is WAY TOO LOUD! More often than not I find myself just unplugging at night to avoid the temptation to speak the wake word and have her blurt out at high volume like some drunk girl at a party that's already wound down. As it is dependent on wifi, any command while not connected will prompt a super loud reply, like say volume down while using the bluetooth function to stream shows or music. Same for when it connects to a device. She just yells out the device serial number. I've tried to find ways to quiet her voice level vs music and I just don't see the option anywhere. 2) For it to be a smart speaker that is compatible with smart devices it sure doesn't seem all that smart. It still needs to be manually connected to other devices that A) that are in the same network, B) have Alexa C) Have Alexa under the same account... D) Are streaming Amazon content. Feels like 2008 all over again. The Alexa app is ok but nowhere near as intuitive as it should be. 3) Echo Dot 3 is NOT a portable, speaker as it has no battery. Maybe they're saving that feature for the 4. I've never had a desktop speaker that I couldn't take with me. There are however 3rd party devices available to remedy this. Overall, like I said, decent sound device. As long as you have stable wifi and the patience to constantly adjust the volume and to the situation you should be fine with it.\n",,Configuration: Device only

Alexa controls allow for speaker pairs, home theater, room groups and multi-room groups, so everything would be great, right?!Well, except for the fact that the devices lose proper connection to the network for these complex setups - if you want to get it working again, you just have to go through the reset process. Except I bought in, and trying to reset all these devices every week or every few days is an abominable, endless chore.So I tell my speakers to play a podcast from the bedroom group, and the device acknowledges, and nothing happens. So I ask to play from the home theater group, acknowledgment, and nothing.I've tried upgrading the router, bought a second router to act as a repeater, and it's just not getting results. Believe me when I tell you that I've spent nearly as much time talking to Amazon support as I have my own family this past year.I would note that Amazon support has been very helpful through the app, but the app itself is abysmal, slow, and riddled with bugs that constantly tell me new echo devices have been discovered on my network.If this stuff worked, it would be amazing. But it doesn't. 1/3rd of the time, things are fine. 1/3 of the time, I'm listening to music and small weird glitches cause sound artifacts and small delays that make the songs choppy. The other 1/3rd, the devices just don't play music when or where I tell them to.At this point I can't even feel okay with selling these off to some sucker. I just want them to play music when and where they're asked, and play audio from my TV. Will they ever work? Only time will tell.\n",,Configuration: Device only

They are kind of cool little tools and I'm honestly not worried that they are ""spying"" on me. I mainly bought them to conveniently play music but I have had some issues with the voice recognition. Regardless of the music service I am using I have this problem, and it seems to be an Alexa voice recognition issue. I believe I speak pretty clearly, and in standard American English, but I can say something like ""Alexa, play the album 'Ruiner' by Alex Noble"" and it will NEVER understand me, no matter how hard I try. It always wants to play something with the word ""Rumor"" in the songname by a random arist, rather than looking through the catalog of the artist I mentioned and finding the closet song, which might be a good way to approach this problem in my opinion. Anyway, this was just an example and it has happened when I have tried to play many different songs and albums.Another issue is the Spotify integration. I was having issues with it and eventually completely de-synced Spotify from all my Alexa devices. According the the app, Spotify is not associated with any of my devices, but for some reason it will still play some content from Spotify. I don't get it at all and if it is user error, it is due to something that was poorly designed, because I'm reasonably smart and can't figure out the error.I'm glad I got the things, and hope this will be improved in time, since all it's knowledge and programming is ""in the cloud.""\n",,Configuration: Device only

We mainly use this as a smart music device that also tells time and weather. Everything worked well when we had Amazon's unlimited echo streaming plan, and it normally picked the correct music, but canceled when we got a newer echo (this one) and someone in our household signed up for Pandora with family sharing. Since then, the experience has been mostly poor. Alexa rarely matches against the correct music (that I know exists on Pandora), and quite often plays offensive music, which is not good when it's mostly for my kids. For example, if you ask Alexa to play the Frozen II soundtrack (for the kids), it plays some random trash. Worse, I asked Alexa to play ""Do You Want To Build A Snowman"" for my daughter, and it keeps trying to play ""Do You Want To Build A Snow Dick"".  This last part likely isn't AMZ's fault, but Pandora doesn't have a cast to Alexa option anymore, so there's no way to get at the music that you actually want it to play without using the Echo as a bluetooth speaker... less than ideal... Alexa should just work regardless of service.I'm a big music fan, so I have hundreds of my albums uploaded to Google Music (Amazon's music locker service is long gone)... but unfortunately those are not available on my echo, because Amazon doesn't allow Google Music on their devices. Maybe they will add this one day, as they did with YouTube TV on the Fire devices.\n",,Configuration: Device only

After setting up free time and subscribing to kindle unlimited we set it up using his preexisting kindle profile. Alexa works with specific commands which doesn\u2019t seem like a problem at the time but when she only recognizes your voice 25% of the time it\u2019s a bit of a pain. All 3 members of my household have different accents coast to coast and no luck with echo dot. On top of that she doesn\u2019t recognize the names of a lot of the 3rd party apps for kids. Setting the up routines was a long glitchy process and the math app was not great. Overall it does preform its basic functions which is why I gave it 2 stars. Nothing puts a parent in a great mood like yelling \u201cRead Harry Potter!\u201d 7 times and hearing \u201cReading Peter Rabbit by Beatrice Potter.\u201d Eventually even the most patient child begins to hate Peter Rabbit all because of Alexa.  After yelling the name of your book 5 times eventually she might get it and if not you can use the phone app.Pros: Can remind kids of chores and will play audiobooks if you open them from your phone.When we were picking out smart speakers for the rest of our home we decided to try Google Home Mini and wow what a difference. Google Home can recognize conversational commands, help kids with math problems, has exceptionally clearer sound in addition to both voice and touch volume controls. So far the only con is figuring out how to edit actions in the middle of the night without google responding verbally. Google will even tell you Alexa has her strengths and Google has hers when you ask who Alexa is. It\u2019s not linked directly to audible but you can play it using the Bluetooth function. It also connects to our smart tv. The only advantage Echo Dot has is a direct connection to order on amazon or audible but given that Alexa opens the wrong book 75% of the time I can only imagine the problems with orders.

So if you set a timer in the kitchen for, say, cookies or something, then go to another room, that timer will only go off in the kitchen even if you have an echo dot by your computer.The app is annoying; it needs a ""duplicate routine"" option for if you need to make multiple similar routines. For example, if you make a routine for ""I'm in the den"" which turns off all the lights except the ones in the den, and then you want to make an ""I'm in the living room,"" you can't just copy and edit the first one. You have to set it up from scratch, which in my apartment means setting six individual lights to off and one on. Each of those is selected from a menu, then you set options in sub menus, so something that should take less then a minute ends up taking up to ten. Plus if you accidentally hit ""back"" it drops all progress and starts over. And there's no option to create routines on PC in a browser where it would be more convenient.The echo dot often doesn't understand what I say. Sometimes I have to repeat commands up to three times.Alexa never shuffles playlists when I ask her to play music, which is only a minor annoyance but it's still annoying.There's a ton of potential for this to be awesome in the next generation, but for now it's just okay.

My house appliances are not electronically automated (I still know how to turn switches on and off), I don't use other voice activated aids nor do I remember command key words readily (so if I say the wrong key word, Alexa has no idea what I want, leaving me to scratch my muddled brain about appropriate synonyms), and I feel it's kind of creepy talking to a dumb computer voice which hasn't been adequately programed to search for my music or queries. Nor is the cell phone app very helpful for finding how to use features which I haven't yet realized that I might not need. Nor is the Amazon Prime Music library very complete, for the kind of classical and jazz music that I like without paying another monthly fee (Pandora - if I could attach to it -  provides a much broader Station association between my song and others I might thumbs up).

I can't tell you whether the problem is with Alexa/Dot or Amazon Music, but I usually have no problem with Amazon Music when I play it through my laptop.  The problems? Sometimes I have to ask Alexa twice to play a music station.  The first time she will confirm the station I've requested... then silence.  Nothing.  So I ask again.  And music...  Sometimes I ask to play a station and  the music starts, then stops after one song... or two songs... or ten minutes... or continues to play (my preferred action) until I tell it to stop.  Sometimes I think it's the act of 'asking', so I use my app.  The same inconsistencies.  And frequently an ad pops up on my app asking if I want to pay MORE for Amazon Music.  Really?  I'm auditioning your service everyday.  You're not winning my money.I'm not sure how I'm going to resolve this.  Pay for another music service? Go back to Google Home?

The further away you are the worse this gets.- I cannot get it to stop blinking yellow notification. I've read multiple sites on how people turn off notification for tip of day, mail, etc. but it still blinks and gives me that tip of day crap. It should've be a very simple configuration and it should work the way I want it, not having me looking up sites after sites for configuration for a simple option maybe just because amazon wants to showcase their featureBecause my sole purpose of getting it is just to give me accurate voice command capability of lights/electronics around the house and not give me unsolicited information. I'll say it around 2.5 star for me at this time.----------------------------------Overall setup is very simple for someone who is somewhat familiar with technologies and can follow instructions.The dot is smaller than I remembered but has surprisingly good sound quality for such small device. It is very nice looking imo and can recognize my command very well. It does sometimes have trouble picking up my voice about 10+ ft away in my fairly opened living room/kitchen/dining room area, I'll have to test this further as it was quite noisy in the room at the time.I also have non-amazon brand smart switches setup and the Alexa app was able to pick it up. I was very impressed because it asked me which room the light switch was at and setup the light switch all by itself without any manual intervention on my part.I got the three-dot deal and one of the box seem to have been opened previously because the seal sticker on the box has been teared off, however the inner plastic wrapping seems intact. As the dot seem to be functioning flawlessly and it seems too big a hassle to return it, I am just going to keep it but just throwing this out there for whoever might care - check your factory seal.I am actually in the process of recommending a smart home system to an elderly relative who would prefer foreign language voice command.

First, it took FOREVER for me to receive them, and I still have not received one of the three ordered.Secondly, the only music platform that seems to work correctly is Amazon music.  On any other platform, the song gets about a quarter of the way to halfway finished and it cuts out to dead air.  When the music resumes, a new song is playing.  I listen to pandora primarily, then apple music and Amazon as my last option.  I purchased them to add easily accessible music in my office, gym, and yoga room.  I contacted amazon and did troubleshooting with no resolution.  They sent me two replacements that are doing the same thing.  The funny thing is if I listen to my second-generation dots and plus I have no issues with any of my music platforms.  It is only the third-generation with the problem; which tells me there is something wrong with this third-generation.  I hope they will take this back and return my money.  I would rather have a refurbished second-generation than not to be able to listen to all of my music platforms.Thirdly, the echo says it is up to date, BUT the tech support representative stated that the software version is not the latest.Lastly, I have to repeat myself multiple times for this echo to wake up and do what is asked.  In my opinion, Amazon had to throw a bunch together to keep up with demand from Prime Days and manufactured a bunch of defective echo dots.I hardly ever do reviews, but I am so annoyed with this situation that I had to let others know what to expect.  This third-generation is not the high-quality Amazon product you have become accustomed.  Do yourself a favor and wait until a new generation becomes available or buy an old one.\n",6 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

We have the big Echo in the kitchen and a dot in all three bedrooms (with another one in the garage attached to one of those chargers that lets me take it outside wirelessly).What infuriates me is that I pay fifteen bucks a month for a family plan so that my son can listen to Old Town Road on a loop in one room, my daughter can sing along with Elsa in her room, and my wife and I can rock out to Deer Tick downstairs.  That's the American dream, right?But it's JUST a dream.  If you tell the dot in my son's room to play sleep sounds, it turns off Nora Jones Radio downstairs and starts playing Ocean Waves there instead of in his room.  I've tried naming the device with the Alexa app and saying ""Play Rain Forest Sounds in Jackson's Room"" but it will inevitably turn OFF the Little Mermaid soundtrack in my daughter's room and play it in there anyway - causing her to get out of bed and complain when I just want them to go to sleep.I figured out a delicate order that will bring balance if I start with the Disney music or audiobook of Harry Potter in her room and THEN tell Alexa to play sounds  in his room with a seemingly endless list of commands (""play rain forest sounds"" ""No, I do not want to pay extra for HD quality forest sounds"" ""enable loop"") but then we're married to sitting in silence downstairs until we go to bed because we don't want to risk changing the noises in their rooms by asking for some Langhorne Slim while we relax on the couch.But of course, if I've got something I'm grooving to during the day downstairs, my son is inevitably going to go into his room and ask for Megadeath (where the HECK did he learn what Megadeath is?! I'm looking at you, Uncle Steve) and, while his room remains quiet, my Frightened Rabbit disappears and it's Symphony of Destruction blasting into my living room.What the heck am I paying for a family plan for?  Maybe I ought to have just one Alexa device that I move from room to room.  When you ask a device to produce some kind of sound, why isn't it THAT device that responds?\n",,Configuration: Device only

Therein lies the problem. Overall, Alexa seems to work well most of the time. But I have two issues with the Echo Dot/Alexa.First is the voice quality. When Alexa speaks it's very muddy. If there's any background noise it's very difficult to understand her. Surprisingly though, when I play music through the Echo Dot it sounds remarkably good. Much better than I anticipated from a speaker so small. IMO, better than the Google (Nest) Home Mini.Second is the integration with the LIFX bulb. Often Alexa will respond that the bulb cannot be located. Then some random number of days pass and she will suddenly see the bulb again. Then 1-3 days later, she looses it again. Very frustrating considering Amazon chose to bundle this bulb with the Echo and it's so unreliable. When she can't find it, Google Assistant and Homekit both have no trouble at all.On the plus side, integration with Amazon services is great. And she's been extremely reliable interfacing with my Sonos One SL speaker.

Amazon music is overall disappointing as the same genre songs are played over and over - you wind up specifying songs and artists. ""Play more like this"" gives you one extra song by the artist - then Alexa plays the same old repertoire ad nausium. Not every song you can think of is available, and Alexa will pick the latest artist if the song is a remake - annoying when you want to hear the original (or don't know the artist of the original song.) Another person with another account lives with me, and their Echo 3 dot plays song through mine, even though they are on separate accounts and in different rooms and not within earshot of the other (how does that happen?)

I own multiple Echo device including an echo, FIreTV, several dots throughout my house.  They all work great except one of the new 3rd generation Dots recently purchased.  That new Dot drops my music streams around 8-10 times per hour, sometimes more...sometimes every song...and has done it right from the start.So what do I do?  I go online to request an exchange for a new functional Dot.  The system FORCES me to chat or speak on the phone with a customer service rep.  Okay, irritating, especially when I could have simply opted to return the item for a refund, and then buying another new one to accomplish this same task.  But, I'll do it.Over 2 hours later, after chatting with David through this time, I've provided lots of ridiculous info, router make and model, distance from router, other device info, etc., some of which may be relevant, but also including a DNA sample (kidding), and get this - approving his request for an Amazon rep to conduct a house visit to gather debug info from the Dot....?!?!?  Seriously, for a $30 device?!  I say ""sure!"" because at this point, I think they make this process as long and drawn out to dissuade people from getting this done...what else am I to think?  What would you think?So, David concludes by saying this will take several days to have the development team triage my data and get back to me via email about next steps...Meanwhile my device dropped the stream 11 times in a little over an hour while chatting with David.  He wraps our chat session by asking if he has addressed all my concerns and questions.  I tell him, well, ""No, not satisfactorily, but you know that don't you David?""  He responds -""Perfect! Have a great evening.""So now, I'm all in to see how utterly absurd this process will be to exchange the Dot for one that functions properly.  It goes without saying that I will not be recommending Echo devices to anyone and will be regaling them with the request for a home visit by Amazon before honoring the exchange request.  I seriously doubt anyone, including you kind readers, will believe it!  But, it's true.  I swear on my dog's life.So, what will come next??  I don't know but am waiting in awe of this stupidity and will update as it goes....UPDATE:  the second Dot that came in the order with the first one is now also dropping pandora streams, so it'll be a return for both, especially since I've not received the aforementioned email from the development team wanting to swing by the house for a debug and beer session.

This is the final straw - I'm ripping these sad, useless devices out and replacing them all with Google Home minis which at least don't try to advertise to me (yet).On another note: I once left a review on an older generation of Amazon Echo, and someone from Amazon literally called me on my mobile phone to ask about the review - but then asked me to provide personal information to confirm it was actually me they were talking to. Are you kidding me? You're going to call me, unsolicited, and then ask me to prove who I am just so you can address a review that I didn't ask to be contacted about? Y'all have seriously misunderstood (or just completely disregarded) the concept of customer experience.

Useful, in theory.","\nMy husband bought our very first Alexa for my birthday because he thought I'd enjoy the ""company"" since I work from home. We've not even had it for a year, and the one he bought me now only acknowledges the wake word, but doesn't do anything you ask it. Even after factory resetting it multiple times, and even though it's never been dropped, damaged, or wet. I contacted customer support and was told these devices only have a 90 day warranty, so our best bet is to just buy another one when they go on sale next. We've bought 5 other devices since the first, and now we're worried that all 5 will eventually fail like the first one. Not sure this is worth the $200+ every year if they're all going to go out like this one, especially with the limited amount of stuff they actually do. The only real thing we use them for is playing music while we do chores (which is great when your hands are soapy, dirty, or covered in oil), or turning off the lights when we're on the couch and in bed and don't want to have to get up again to turn them off. It is at least cool that you can group the devices together and then play music on all of them at once if you want, or that you can drop in on other rooms instead of yelling at each other. Other than that, how can we justify spending that kind of money on something that won't last and is just an ""okay"" speaker otherwise? It's just like my Apple Watch - expensive and useful in theory, but in practice not worth the badge. You use it for a couple of things, but it's definitely not as useful as they've told us.\n",,Configuration: Device only

That's what it's good at.What I didn't anticipate was that the base would be so overpowering that listening to voices on podcasts, the news, or youtube videos would be near impossible.  Imagine everything is down pitched a whole octave.  I didn't have enormously high expectations but a cheap no-name brand speaker does better than this.  Going into settings and cranking the bass all the way down helps a little, but not enough.  That said if the only thing you will do with your speaker is listen to music, you might enjoy the bass-heavy sound.  Just know that using this to listen to people talk or listen to dialogue is probably out of the question.My other critique is that these speakers should really have an audio-in jack instead of audio out, or better yet, both.  If I wanted to have an audio out jack, I'd buy an Alexa Input device for half the price.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  Maybe the regular Echo and Echo Studio are better.\n",,Configuration: Device only

The speaker has four microphones on it and they pick up voices amazingly well. The speaker looks nice and I really like the buttons on top that make controlling it even easier. I also think that the speaker (actually 3 speakers within) has the potential to sound pretty good. But, there are some issues that really keep me from enjoying this. First: the sound tuning just seems off. It is really bass heavy which would normally be great but since the speaker is so small it just makes everything else sound less pronounced and muddy. Second: the sound randomly becomes distorted sometimes, especially when playing on a Bluetooth speaker. I\u2019m not talking about a little white noise, I mean it sounds like you\u2019re losing signal to a radio station; it cuts in and out.

I have no desire for yet another bill every month so I figured it'd be okay and save space. I thought the free version would just have normal commercials and adds but the music would be fine. Well the ""FREE"" listening option without signing up and paying every month is a joke. No matter what style of music you choose to listen to it only shuffles through 15 to 20 songs from each style you choose. It plays the same handful of songs over and over. At least half of these songs are lesser known or lesser wanted versions like the Whitesnake ""hobo"" version of ""Here I go Again"" if you ask to hear 80's hair metal for example. The volume of each song is different as well. Some are a lot louder than others and you have to keep adjusting the volume as you listen if you want it all the same. The speaker strength is nothing to brag about either even for such a small device.  Also, the music styles you chose will sometimes be contaminated with songs from other styles. Adding insult to injury Amazon sticks their own spoken adds in among the terrible selection of ""FREE"" music you get telling you to join up for better options. And yes, I know this thing is supposed to be used for and with other stuff and I'm assuming if you pay every month it'd be a million times better. I'm just giving my opinion on what I wanted it for. If you don't sign up for the paid version you're basically getting a 45-minute commercial that repeats.

For a cheap-ish bluetooth speaker it isn\u2019t too bad, but depending on how you use you will find some limitations. Sonically no one will be blown away, but it functions.Connectivity: This has been a nightmare. I have two of these. They will randomly show the blue and orange lights, go back into setup modes, turn on Alexa from disabled and require completely removing the pairing and starting over. Super frustrating and both units do it. Bluetooth seems pretty good, but can delay at times. I have yet to have any luck with the aux cable, though... on either of them.Alexa: It can hear me and most of the time understands very basic stuff. It doesn\u2019t integrate with a lot of stuff I use, so it severely limits functionality.Compatibility: No Google support sucks. I have hoping to use the speakers in a right and left config as they had been setup, but you are limited in that regard. Play Music not having native support sucks, but I can just connect to bluetooth. It would great to have the wizardry available outside of some weird backend stuff that Amazon is doing on their servers.Summary: If you get this free or for a dollar or something, awesome. 100% no-go at full price. If you have invested in another ecosystem, make sure to verify full compatibility, even at half off. You can pickup wireless speakers for around the same price that are better, but lack Alexa.

Towards the end of summer, every other 'Alexa' request/engagement became an unwarranted invasion of thought, focus, activity.

So, I rarely write negative reviews. But I'm so shocked by how bad all of my 3 Alexa's are functioning that I have to leave feedback.First of all, expect at least half of the functions not to be working. Even the easiest things like changing the wifi on your Alexa. Or Alexa recognizing devices. My devices are all about 3 months old and since the beginning, everything was a fight. Connecting lamps was a fight. Using spotify is a fight (she chooses the wrong songs all the time, even if the song is super popular).And Fire Tv has been the worst so far. I got a Fire Tv stick just so I could use voice control for Netflix or Prime. But from the very start Alexa only searched for movies but never played them. Costumer service could not help I had just had to accept. If you want to increase or decrease volume, she suddenly mutes the tv all together. Lately she hasn't done anything for fire tv at all.I got all 3 Alexa echo dots at the same time, thinking they would work. One of them I gave to my father. The app is supposed to work on Android 5.0 or higher. Of course the app did not work on his Android 5.01 phone. After hours of trying to fix it, I connected it to my own phone which is actually not a good idea but I had no choice. Anyway, of course connecting smart lamps (philips hue) took ages too.In the end I have to say the amount of time I struggled with Alexa overweighs the time she was of use. I just tried to connect my Alexa to a new wifi and guess what? Even this easy function does not work because Amazon makes everything to complicated and wants Alexa to connect to my phone's wifi, and not directly to the wifi itself.Facepalm. Overall I'm really disappointed, Amazon. By the way, if you use Alexa to send messages, expect her to cut you off at random so you have to repeat the whole message again.The amount of rage trying to make it work is insane. And despite what you might be thinking, I'm not actually the rage kind of person. But this is just ridiculous.\n",3 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

The device will randomly reset itself to the second lowest volume setting. I will increase the volume, and it will stay increased for a while, but then will inevitably reset itself to volume level 2. This happens at least daily, sometimes multiple times a day.This started about 2 months ago. I tried factory resetting it, and when that didn't work I called Amazon expecting them to help me through this. They originally told me that this was a mass issue they were experiencing with my specific device, and that I would be added to their mass trouble ticket and given a call back to follow up. I never got a call back; three weeks later, I called to follow up.The second time I talked with Amazon, they said there was no mass ticket/issue, and they had no idea what I was talking about. Then they told me that because it was out of warranty I was SOL. The best they can do is offer me a 15% discount to buy another echo device....that I'm now sure will just break down as soon as it's out of warranty.This is the first time I've truly been disappointed in Amazon's customer service.

If I wanted to be ignored every other time when I called it's name, I'd talk to my kids. At first I thought it may be a noise issue. (Too much stuff going on in the background.) Unfortunately, it will do the same thing when it's dead silent. Other occasions, it will recognize that I've said ""Echo"" but will not complete the demand.  For example, I'll say ""Echo,"" it lights up and it lights up. I say ""Set alarm for 0430"" almost immediately after and it's a coin toss as to if it will actually do anything.  It also tends to sporadically stop playing Amazon Music. I haven't had any problems with that when playing the local stations. I've checked the connection when it acts up and WiFi seems to be 100%, so I don't believe any of this is simply a connection issue.

It simply does not work.  I have to leave a review because it has absolutely driven me mad trying to link it, trying to get it to play my Apple music, trying to get it to do the simplest things that its own instruction book tells you it should do.  So tired of Alexa telling me I don't know how to do that when it is as simple request as to turn on the newly purchased Smart TV that came with the very Echo Dot, all of which was paired multiple times.  Then, there's the Apple music pairing issue where on some days it works and on others not so much.  Prepare yourself pls.  You will go crazy trying to pair it and to figure out why in the Alexa app it shows everything as paired but there is Alexa telling you that you still have to pair it.  Over and over again you will lose sanity trying to get it to simply play a song right in front of you.  No way to override the madness and to shove the damn song down Alexa's throat so she will spit it back out at you to inevitably play the one song right there on the app.  And then there is the issue of telling Alexa to play an album only to have her play one song from the album instead of the entire thing an what seems to be a concerted effort to only play Amazon music.My advice whether this Echo Dot was free or $100 or $20 - don't do it.  Don't buy it.  Save your sanity.  Save your precious time that will be invested in fixing all the problems that will arise and suck you in so you can get this DUMB PIECE OF EQUIPMENT to work correctly.Horrible piece of crap doesn't really do it justice.  If it was free to me, I'd take a hammer to it.  That, truly, would give me joy right after Alexa tells me she doesn't know how to do something she's done a million times over.

Do not ask Alexa for information, as it will mislead you.Positive: It connects to and controls smart home devices fairly easily, with minor bugs.Example: I can turn on and control some settings on an air conditioner, but it doesn't read the temperature correctly so I can't tell it to increase or decrease based on that.

I couldn't get the Dot to connect, so I contacted customer support.  The Amazon rep did a couple of things then said he couldn't connect the Dot because my computer had ""a ton"" of infections blocking the set-up.  He said he would clean out the viruses ""for free"", but I needed to have an anti-virus program installed.  He said the free anti-virus program I was using was not only useless, but actually part of the problem, and inferred that my current computer service tech was ripping me off.  He then wanted me to choose one of three anti-virus programs, one for $150, one for $250 and one for $400.  I don't like being pressured into making a decision, so I ended the call.  I contacted a completely different local service guy to come look at my computer.  He came and spent an hour checking my computer  and connecting the Dot.  He told me there were no viruses in my computer, and while the anti-virus program I was using was not the one he recommended, it was not a bad program.  After getting the Dot connected, I tried to get it to play music.  ""Alexa"" told me it would cost $9.99 a month to connect the Dot- I currently pay $3.99 for the Gen 2.

Purchased 2 additional sets of smart light bulbs that are Alexa compatible. Found that using numbers to dimlights works best. Example ; Alexa dim light to 25%. .... We currently have 2 Alexa units in use. Microphone is a probable issue for the voice issue but I'm still experimenting with placement as a remedy. Example; One unit is on the floor in the hallway. A possible solution to the problem may be mounting on a wall. Also there is an issue when 2 units are in use. I have a intermittent problem when say one unit is playing music and the other is off. When I say Alexa play music everywhere the second unit will change the station I was enjoying. Like and technology this thing is mostly good but still has some bugs. The Alexa guard feature is basically worthless. It will only detect breaking glass to send to an alert. I've had maintenance people and myself inside the home when the guard feature is activated..... no alerts. So don't get a false sense of security if you rely on this a a burglar alarm. Overall the Alexa is like a ""clapper"" on steroids. A clapper is a switch from long ago that when you clapped your hands lights would go on and off. So basically this echo thing is a lot more than that. To make lights and appliances work you must have a smart plug of light. Lights can be purchased for about 12$ each. The light feature is nice as Alexa can change the light color. Alexa does get a passing grade but still not going to be 100% with the current generation.\n",,Configuration: Device only

Once you know how to use it, and of course, how to connect to all your equipment (took me a while to get my TV right), then you'll have a better experience.To get Alexa work at full power you need subscriptions, wireless equipment connected to what you want to control (power plugs, lights, TVs, soundbars, etc) If you don't have it, Alexa is a beautiful and expensive paperweight that sometimes you ask something.I got it with Prime audio unlimited. It is great until you don't use it every time because you have a lot of other stuff going on. And you have less money to spend in frivolities and the first things to go are subscriptions.In conclusion: If you have the money to spend in new tech (wait for BF) and then connect all your house, then Alexa will be your best friend. She can wake you up, transfer the sound from one place to other, turn on your coffee machine, TV, turn off the light... you'll be a spoiled person or a dependent one, pick your poison :)Alexa is just the first step for a touchless experience at home.

For example, if you ask: ""Alexa what is the score of the [sports team] game?"" it will almost never give you what you want on the first try.The sound quality for the price is bad, even bluetooth speakers that are half the cost of this sound much better plus they are usually wireless.The power brick is huge, it would be much better if it could accept a usb type C or even an old micro usb, but no luck. They have to give you an enormous proprietary power brick that is big and ugly.Sometimes when you get a notification, like when an Amazon package gets delivered, there is a yellow light on the device.

Over the years as the devices grew to be more ""intelligent"", the voice recognition has gotten far worse and Alexa now talks to me on its own whenever I give it a simple command. ""By the way..."" she says after, ""Alexa, turn off all the lights"" and then I get info on how to play scrabble with the dot in my bedroom when I am trying to go to sleep. These ""By the way..."" moments have become more frequent and lengthy.

It has gotten so bad that I unplugged and sold all of my Echo devices on eBay because the trade-in prices here are a joke.In fairness, the audio and video quality as well as the physical quality of the device itself are incredibly high.

Compared to the Google Home it falls very short. For example one very useful feature on the Google product is the capability to skip forward or backward within a podcast.

This is something it shares with Google Home, however it is much more blatant on the Alexa. On neither system is it possible  to upload your own music to an account so that you can listen to it on your smart speaker using voice commands.

To get some songs, such as the Beatles' ""Old Brown Shoe,"" it requires a $3.99/month fee.  It won't play some songs or plays the versions I don't want.  I find it extremely difficult to get it to play some classical music.  For example, Mozart's 12th serenade (K.375) is my favorite piece of music, and I can't figure out how to get Alexa to play it.  I have given up on any specific Haydn string quartet.  In a different genre, it plays the short version of Manfred Mann's ""Blinded by the Light"" instead of the long version.  On the other hand, it is great for playing Sirius XM radio and radio stations.  It does many things well, but it is not great for classical music and odd bits of popular music.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I got it for free for signing up for my auto-maker's extra services so at least I've invested nothing (and it works great for starting my car on those cold days).  I wouldn't waste money on it though. The competition's inexpensive option is far and away better sound quality all around and connects to just as many devices (except ordering from Amazon).  So, beware, Dot works but get used to repeating yourself or cranking up the volume to understand Alexa and turning it back down so you don't blast yourself with any other sound coming out of it.\n",,Configuration: Device only

This worked out well until I cancelled my SiriusXM account and switched to Amazon music. When I streamed Sirius from my echos sound was good and the volume was consistent over every song. Enter Amazon music and now when I try to stream music the volume for each song is all over the map. Set one song to volume 5 and its sounds good, but the next some comes on like you turned it up to 10, then you turn that down and you might not be able to even hear the next song. This only happens when streaming from the echo devices themselves. If you are streaming music from the app or to your echo from a smart phone this is not a problem, because the app has a loudness normalization option that can be turned on. The echo devices have no such option. So you can stream to your devices just not from them which renders them kinda useless for multi room music.I talked to tech support today, but they do not seem to see this as a critical issue.

I've selected Spotify as the default music service through the Alexa app (note: can't do this on web!), and it still refuses to understand. The end result is any time I ask it to play a playlist on Spotify, it can't because it's looking on Amazon Music - or worse, it plays some random song from Amazon Music that I don't want. It's incredibly frustrating and, consequently, I wouldn't recommend it.The audio quality is pretty good though. It can also get loud.

For example, if you ask it something like ""what day does October 26 land on"", it'll tell you it's a Monday and then continue by saying ""by the way, did you know that I can help you find October decoration tips?"" or something like that. I will never, ever, in my life care about something like that. Or, if you set it up to give you delivery notifications, it'll also remind you to write reviews of products you purchased, which is entirely not important compared to delivery reminders. Even if you turn on brief mode and turn off follow up mode, it still gives you these prompts. It's INCREDIBLY ANNOYING.Also, another small thing, but it only has 10 volume settings available by voice, which is frustrating because sometimes at night 1 is too soft and 2 is too loud. Kind of absurd that in 2020 they can't have more than 10 volume settings when literally every other appliance I own has 50-100.\n",One person found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

However, outside of Amazon Music access and checking the weather, I have found the Alexa service to be nearly useless.Only 20% of the questions I ask elicit a response with Alexa quoting online references (as expected). The other 80% result in a ""Hmm, I'm not sure"" or some other generic response. Asking the hours of operation or phone number for local businesses is a nightmare, making phone calls usually results in Alexa calling the wrong contacts, and the list could go on forever. These issues are all despite the fact that I am very articulate, well spoken and have eliminated physical distance as the cause of the issue. It all boils down to Alexa's inadequate technology. My brother has a Google Assistant and can ask it virtually anything and it will be roughly 95% accurate, making me regret my purchase.My second greatest issue is Alexa's inability to differentiate between voices. Due to this, the Echo Dot began spending more time muted or unplugged from power once my five year old figured out that ""Alexa"" is a magic word. There are no technical or design limitations to implementing this feature, it is simply Amazon's unwillingness to do so. Their unwillingness has virtually rendered this Echo Dot useless. Others across the internet have this same issue and have expressed this same opinion.Not really a complaint but a suggestion for a great feature, would be the Echo Dot being able to remotely alert the owner of noises other than just glass break and smoke alarm detection. Having the option to select to be alerted when hearing any voice and any noise at all would render my home alarm system nearly obsolete.\n",,Configuration: Device only

Anyone can enable skills on your device by just telling alexa to enable that skill. ""So what?"" you say. Well here is a fairly common example of how that will be problematic.Lets say you have a child who decides to enable skills that are not appropriate for your child. While there are some parental controls the ability for the PARENT to determine what is or is not appropriate for their child is critical. Personally I don't want my children to be preached to or missionized to  - but there are plently of skills that would open that door up. While I can disable any skill from the app - it can simply be re-enabled by the child just by asking alexa to enable it.  Not only that but Alexa will frequently respond to a request with ""I have a skill that can be enabled for that - do you want to enable it?"" All the child has to do is say yes. This is ridiculous.

However, there is no way to verify that the answer I am getting is based on the question that I actually asked.  It seems that Alexa does not understand all of the words and I can't tell what it missed.  Also, when it spits back names of famous people, for example, it slurs the names just enough so that I can't tell what the answer was.  I don't have that problem when I ask ""Ok google"" the same questions.I get the impression that I am supposed to spend a huge hunk of time trying to teach it to understand all of my electronics in the house.

I bought the Dot when it was on sale for $29.99 because, not only did I now need one for my bedroom, but it was cheaper than a lot of alarm clock options. The best of both worlds. WELL. The error message of Not Being Able to Connect to the Internet became a daily problem very quickly. I tried every troubleshoot from every blog I could find, and I spent quite some time on the phone with amazon trying to figure out why it wasn\u2019t working. Surprise! If it isn\u2019t connected to the internet, the alarm won\u2019t go off. So I woke up late for work and decided it was the last straw. I think I got a dud and it\u2019s going back.As if this wasn\u2019t already kind of disappointing, I am not allowed to do an even swap for a new Dot. The only option I was given, aside from mailing it in and having techs look at it for an undisclosed amount of time was to return it (since I am still within the return window.) However, the price has risen to $49.99, so if I want a new one I have to pay the difference, which is ridiculous. My Echo Plus stays connected just fine. And the Dot was maybe 20 feet from my router, so, again, I think I just got a dud. It\u2019s disappointing that they couldn\u2019t do an even exchange of a Dot for a Dot, especially since this thing stopped working almost immediately. And frankly, when it worked it was a cool gadget, but I am not sure it\u2019s worth $50.\n",,Configuration: Device only

The Dot for some reason was set to using a different language and was actually set to a different region than where my account is located. I'm in the US but it set it up as a Japanese Echo. Japanese voice over and Japanese UI in the app. It took multiple resets and even changing my password multiple times to fix. It also defaulted to using an old phone number of mine when I tried setting it up. I had to create a new profile for it to use my current number. When playing Amazon Music, the songs have a tendency to stop abruptly and sputter out, although I'm not entirely sure if it's the device or the Music service that could use some fixing up.

I've tried everything to get this piece of trash to cooperate with playing music off Spotify- of course you can't hook it up with Ethernet, but putting it right next to the access point should be good enough, but I guess not.

No other wireless device in my home will drop off in the middle of a song while using the service, except for these stupid plastic POS hockey pucks.

I checked my account, I don't have reorder notifications turned on. It took a chat with support to direct me 4 layers deep in the app menu where I could opt out. I didn't drop $150 on speakers just to have them advertise to me within my own home. What a garbage move.UPDATE: Now, the speaker has started asking me to review/rate products out of the blue.

The twi things Alexa usually gets right is switch control and saying the word space when spelling words..... it often spells the wrong word but at least when it spells ""big car"" for my daughter instead of ""bigger,"" it places the word ""space"" between the ""g"" and the ""c.""  I wouldn't recommend an Alexa item to anyone that wasn't intending to voice control switches.  If you want intelligent answers get a Google.\n",,Configuration: Device only

It did not take long to realize why they were giving them away.  The set up was seemingly simple how ever the function of the unit pails in comparison to my two Google home minis.  When playing music the audio cuts out constantly. Sometimes it will pickup were it left off and other times it will skip to the next song.  After doing a quick search online it became quite apparent that this is a largely know problem.  Sorry Amazon but you have some work to do.  Let me know if you want  it back....  After speaking with someone who instructed how to perform and update on the device as it is several versions old it did not work.  I spoke to another rep this morning who insists that it is my WiFi and completely ignored the software level even after being told several times.  The product is in a business with top of the line WiFi which supports 5 vehicle scan tool devices with no problems.  Finally she instructed me to ask ALEXA to update software which i cant do because that function is not available with the current software level.  So frustrated and not even worth it since it was free.

Then I realized it has a mind of its own as to when to stop playing music, for example after 4 songs, give or take. If you ask it to continue playing the same station, it starts over with the exact same song sequence.

This Echo Dot (3rd gen) was a free bonus from SiriusXM, and I got what I paid for.  The audio is so muffled it can be quite difficult to understand, and no matter what you do with the equalizer settings it doesn't really get better.  In our brave new world of wearing masks to ward off the evil viruses, the Echo Dot seems to have been built with the muffling effects of a mask in mind.  My 3 year old Ecobee thermostat with Alexa has crystal clear audio by comparison, and my Google Home Mini devices are even clearer.  I wasted about half an hour chatting with tech support and trying several resets, etc. and ultimately exchanged the first Dot for another just in case it was simply defective, but the second one was just as bad.  Reading various posts across the web, there are countless complaints about the muffled sound, and it seems like the most common solution is to connect a quality external speaker (which is preposterous to me). I'm quite disappointed and don't anticipate trying another Amazon device of any kind for quite some time.\n",12 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

I ordered an Echo Dot from Amazon for my grandson as a gift. After gifting him the item the setup process could not be completed. It would repeatedly not connect to the internet. As I had time throughout the day on occasion, I would try and get it to work with the same problems. Frustrations continually mounted and I gave in and contacted customer service. They had the device's serial number listed with some other account and ""blacklisted"" (whatever that means). Hours, chats, and phone calls have exhausted much of my time and resolved nothing. Customer service says its a technical issue and the technicians say they can't do anything because I have the wrong serial number. That is an incorrect statement by Amazon because I am 100% sure I have the correct serial number and it was never completely set up , never reported lost, and never connected to internet successfully. The box is even still in my possession. They will not take the item back for exchange. They will not do anything to resolve the issue, they just want to send me in phone and chat circles which resolve nothing.\n",,Configuration: Device only

If I didn't get this on super-sale, I would be returning. Not impressed.It may be fine for you if you don't care about music quality and use it mainly for the voice control functions, but I have no interest in that, so my review is coming from that perspective.\n",,Configuration: Device only

Then, once I got it up and running, it would wake up with the wake word, but listen and listen, and never respond to what I say. Amazon admitted that it was a bug with that specific device, and I was sent a replacement. However, when the replacement arrived, it has an internal power failure and could never actually boot. Which put me in a stuck situation, because I already used my warranty service on the first one, even though I have two duds.

They refuse to replace this gray one with the white one or honor the Black Friday discount for me to just purchase a new white one once I return the charcoal. I like the echo. I enjoy my other one greatly but if I\u2019ve already returned one once for the exact same problem, I don\u2019t want to keep sending them back and fourth with the same problem.

For example, we want to use it in to control the light on our outdoor motion camera when we're outside at night, but it isn't capable.

The Alexa app chooses songs for you at random and they could or could not be songs that are saved to your library. I hope in the future that it will be allowed for you to play songs directly from Apple Music.\n,,Configuration: Device only

Finally managed without tech 2 get two of the 3 setup by just doing it over and over. Never could even with tech support get the third to work. So lady said she was sending replacement for one that would not connect. Received 2 days later and spent 3 hours and it would not connect either. Original 2 took about 2 minutes total.

DOES NOT WORK with any android phone, google product, or apple product as a connected stereo unit.  They do work individually, but that defeats the purpose.  JBL, Bose just to name a couple provide a richer much better sound for a single speaker than does the amazon echo dot system.

I troubleshooted the probem with computer software; I googled the issue - didn't find anything.  Just beware, be very aware!\n",,Configuration: Device only
