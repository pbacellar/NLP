Echo_Dot_5th_Gen_2022_release_With_bigger_vibrant_sound_helpful_routines_and_Alexa,29.99,,,Dave Bolduc,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on March 14, 2023",Did Alexa get stupider or is it just me?,"\nThe product looks quite sharp. The design look is quite pleasant and the volume and sound quality are remarkably good for a unit the size of a softball. The WiFi range is lacking, severely. My office is the farthest room away from my router but she is the only device with connectivity issues. I have a 2012 laptop that gets 4 bars in the same spot. She gets about 2. The voice recognition software is very impressive. She can distinguish my voice clearly from others with a room full of several chatting people and music/tv going in the backround. I have a very odd accent as I've spent each quarter of my 40 years in a different corner of the United States but she seems to have adapted rather easily and rarely fails to understand a command on the first try. I pulled stars because despite all her new bells and whistles she seems to have lost quite a bit of her playfulness and more basic commands. When she misunderstands a command, she does not even get it close and I get a lot of the defacto ""I'm sorry I can't do that"" responses to simple queries. When I was younger I remember sitting having an hour long smart-alec b.s. trash talking session with my uncle's Alexa. This one is boring and no fun to joke around with. She also cannot retain instructions and preferences by voice. Some can be done via the app. But if I wanted to interact with the app on my phone, I wouldn't have bought the pod. I've told her endless times that Spotify is my preferred music player, but unless I specify Spotify in the command she defers to Amazon music. Overall she's become more Amazon's than my own product. Much less independent. Amazon should be giving these away for free for the amount of permission and intrusions needed just to use her. It claims she can integrate with any Bluetooth audio device. This is a lie. She can scan and find her own products no problem but my expensive non-amazon Bluetooth audio devices are invisible to her. The Alexa accessories like light switches, cameras, speakers, thermostats are fairly cheap and basic and allow little to no user customization or expansion. The level of integration is also very basic. About as complex as simply getting a ""clap-on/clap off"" light switch. Now if there was a smart plug hub where I could plug in all my office devices and instruct her to power on my workstation upon entry to my office(meaning activate my computer, desk light, air conditioning, and interactive display) but leave the rest of my electrical devices plugged in there deactivated unless instructed otherwise, that would be neat. I'm also somehow quite uncomfortable with giving her access to any cameras in her home as we know Alexa has behaved as a spy and unauthorized gatherer of personal information in the past. This model has a ""privacy mode"" based on the honor system and a very reassuring red light to designate this.  Yeah, trust is a hard thing to get back once you've betrayed it. She does not have a battery. This is a major design flaw. My 20 year old clock radio has a backup but my brand new Alexa does not. So every single time we lose power or I have to unplug her to move her, I have to go through the ENTIRE process of putting her back into setup mode, reconnecting her to my wifi. An absolute insufferable pain. Also, she does things for no apparent reason, which again makes me nervous. Normally when idle or not in a set mode, her base black out. Occasionally I will be watching her and she will just begin to pulse a color at the base for random periods of time for no explainable reason. I've asked her to explain herself and she plays dumb. Sometimes a song will come on in shuffle play that I will like and I will ask her afterwards to identify the last song she played. She cannot do this. I ask her to identify the last task I had her perform, she cannot do this. I ask her why she is blinking, she cannot do this. She can adjust her volume up or down one small phase at a time verbally, but mutes the music while executing the command but does not pause it. To go from very quiet to very loud is a process of about 30 seconds, 10 requests, and a starting over of the track. Overall she is limited, does not learn. Little to no AI, and is mostly an exercise in frustration rather than convenience. Another MAJOR design flaw, she cannot be made to respond only to my voice or to refuse a specific voice. We learned this the hard way with my young nephew who spent a good 20 minutes playing hit or miss demanding calls to names he was guessing from my address book and even our local police. A 5 year old is going to stupid things. A 5 year old is going to talk to and play with damn near anything that will play with it.  How in god's name did no one at Amazon think it a good idea to put a ""parent"" or ""owner"" mode where she answers only to my voice, or uses that amazing voice recognition software to single out and restrict a voice. Does anyone at Amazon have children? Or do they simply not like Amazon products either? If you are willing to do things her way, she can be an asset. If you want something that can adapt to and work with you, she's a frustration and a liability. If you want an attractive centerpiece for your livingroom to impress your friends with your ""smart house"", shes perfect. I thought newer would be better. Overall I'm dissapointed with this product and miss my echo dot.\n",81 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
Echo_Dot_5th_Gen_2022_release_With_bigger_vibrant_sound_helpful_routines_and_Alexa,29.99,,,Nick,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on April 23, 2023",Not really the upgrade I expected,"\nI previously had an Echo Dot 3rd generation and thought it was time to upgrade.  I was hoping some of the previous kinks in the product may have been worked out with the latest version.My first impressions with the overall sound quality were quite noticeable.  It sounded louder, with more bass and definition than the 3rd Gen, particularly with music streaming (SiriusXM or Spotify)Unfortunately after a few weeks having this, I noticed a couple things that I didn't like.First, many times I can't get it to hear me, or respond to the wake word.  There are times where I must repeat myself several times, or even yell close to the device for it to respond. The responsiveness and ability to properly understand my instructions is actually worse than the 3rd generation Echo Dot.The other significant issue is that the volume level radically changes from barely being able to hear, to being way too loud.  This is particularly noticable when playing my ""Flash Briefing"" where there are many skills in a sequence, going from one news feed or podcast to another.I know that each streaming service may have slight differences in volume levels but this speaker only makes it worse compared to the 3rd generation Echo dot I was using.I suggest Amazon make audio or volume normalizing a priority.  This problem is becoming a huge annoyance as more audio streaming services are being added to the platform.Despite having to delete my voice profile and retrain it several times, voice recognition is more of an issue, being misunderstood, or not heard at all.  My old echo dot 3rd gen was much better in terms of recognition and ability to keep the volume levels more or less at a consistent level.\n",110 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
Echo_Dot_5th_Gen_2022_release_With_bigger_vibrant_sound_helpful_routines_and_Alexa,29.99,,,Imatron,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on December 5, 2022","The most infuriating product ever, and I don't want to live without it.","\nWhen you buy an Amazon Alexa device, you are essentially buying a dedicated access device to talk to Amazon's computers over the internet. The device typically only has enough processing power to scan for it's wake word, and then relay what it hears afterwards to Amazon's servers, which then relays the server's response back to your Echo. Even older units like my 2nd gen dot aren't obsolete because they access the same server software as this new model, and won't become obsolete unless Amazon decides to shut those servers down or exclude an older model from service due to a hardware specific security issue.Out of the box, and after linking to an amazon account and punching in some settings, you can set alarms, timers, ask math questions, ask it to spell words for you, ask the time, check the weather, temperature (Indoors and outdoor temps with this model) and quite a bit more. Sometimes I think to myself ""I wonder if it can tell do this for me?"" and a quick question later, I discover a new function. You can further expand it's abilities by linking ""skills"" to your amazon account, which are it's equivalent of a phone app. There are also thousands of gag answers and Easter egg responses, like asking it to beam you up, or fire the torpedos, complete with matching star trek sound effects. It even has the option of asking it to answer to the name ""Computer"" (Ziggy, Echo, Amazon, and Alexa are other names you can ask it to go by at this time).Some skills are as simple as activating them from your phone, or telling the Alexa itself to enable it if you know the skill's name. Some skills need more work and account linking on the PC to set up. Skills can include audio adventure games, podcasts, specific news outlets, music streaming services you've subscribed to. My most used skill is Logitech Harmony, which links it to my Harmony hub IR blaster, a separate device I bought on sale and which allows me to turn my TV on, control it's volume, change input, mute sound, etc.For all that I enjoy about this product, Amazon makes it do SO MANY STUPID IRRITATING THINGS, and many of these issues could be resolved by adding a simple setting to turn it off. Most notable of these irritations, is the inability to turn off it's ""By the way"" messages. Imagine it's 3 am and your having trouble sleeping, and ask it what the time is. All you want is the time, but then Amazon wants you to know that ""Its 3:31pm, by the way Shaquel O'neal thinks-"" and your either issuing an order to shut it up which is itself distracting and annoying, or forced to listen to it further distract you and anyone around you from sleep. Mind you, this is with it's ""brief mode"" turned on, which is supposed to make it less talkative. Amazon also sometimes takes the liberty of adding skills to your account, like some kind of Samuel L Jackson app, and I heart Radio, which makes it fudge the details on some commands like ""Turn off Tron Bulb Delta"" (All my stuff is under the ""Tron"" name, including light bulbs) and mistakes it for a command to ""Play Trombone music"". Until I figured this out and disabled the radio skill, it was a 50/50 nightly occurrence that turning off my light groups to sleep would result in less than helpful music. Although I imagine some of these are intended to train you on it's functionality over time, if I want it to do something, Ill ask it. I don't need it telling me to "" by the way, try saying-"". Whats even more annoying is the fact it will tell you the same suggestions over and over. No Amazon, I don't want you to play white noise for me. You've told me no less than 10 times. I'm sure your proud of your white noise recordings, but I heard you the first time. STOP ASKING ME. DONT ASK ME IN THE FIRST PLACE. And mind you, these are just the annoying issues related to trying to SLEEP with the thing in operation. There is so many other annoying ""by the way"" messages.\n",12 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
Echo_Dot_5th_Gen_2022_release_With_bigger_vibrant_sound_helpful_routines_and_Alexa,29.99,,,Missy Hoppe,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on January 16, 2023",Wish I would have kept my second generation dots,"\nI have been an Alexa user ever since 2015; got an invitation to buy the 1st generation echo, and that device is still at my parents' house. For many years, I was very happy with the three white 2nd generation Echo dots I had here in my apartment. Thanks to their built in  headphone jacks, I had each of them connected to a pair of Bose mediamate speakers, and they sounded awesome! Everything was working beautifully, but when I heard that the 5th generation dots not only had built in temperature sensors, but also that they came in blue, I couldn't resist. So, I found a new home for my three faithful 2nd generation dots and bought the new deep sea blue ones as soon as they were released this past October.I was disappointed to discover that Amazon had removed the headphone jack on the new dots, but it wasn't the end of the world by any means. After all, these new dots do have significantly better sound. If the loss of the headphone jack was the only issue, I wouldn't be writing this review. I sometimes feel that my old echo dots understood me more clearly and made fewer mistakes, but even that, I can deal with for the most part.My biggest issue with these new dots is an admittedly weird, possibly even eunique one, but it's enough to make me seriously regret my purchase. On my old dots, I used a morning routine from the gallery; I believe it was called ""weather after alarm."" When I dismissed my alarm at 5:00 each weekday, Alexa would say good morning and then tell me the weather. It was a great way to start my day, but unfortunately, it hasn't worked even once since I got these new dots. I've tried every trouble-shooting method under the sun: most of them multiple times, and no matter what, I cannot get a routine to trigger when I dismiss my alarm. I've tried contacting Amazon technical support on numerous occasions, and have only been advised to perform the same trouble shooting steps I've already tried. I know it's a minor issue in the grand scheme of life but it boggles my mind that I can't seem to get anyone at Amazon to help investigate more thoroughly and maybe determine whether or not there's a software bug with the new dots that is causing this issue. I've tried researching this issue on google and youtube, and there just aren't any answers out there, so maybe it is user error, although I have no clue how that's possible at this point.Bottom line: as much as I make use of the feature that will allow Alexa to tell me the indoor temperature, if I had it to do over again, I would have just kept my old dots until they stopped working. My advice would be that if you already have echo devices that are meeting your needs, give the 5th generation dots a hard pass.\n",18 people found this helpful,Color: Deep Sea BlueConfiguration: Device only

And they still seem like just a toy. And one thing I want to bring out too if you're buying. Alexa, they now decided that they know better than you what you want on your playlist. So if you take your time and set up a playlist for say soft music that you want, Amazon says no. We know better than you. We're going to add songs into it. And if you don't like it, you'll have to pay $7.99 a month from music. Again. It's the big guy beating up on the little guy anyway he can to get more money out of you.

Day 1 [3 days ago] the device would not set up fully, after 2 hours on phone with tech support it fully worked. Hung up and 5 minutes later it stopped working. Since then I have called tech support 5 times but to no avail. One time I was yelled it, twice hung up on, once told Alexa couldn\u2019t do anything but play music, another time was told to call light bulb manufacturer etc. After all this the device is still not fully working!All agents do not listen (except the very first one I spoke with. God, I wish I could talk to her again.  She was AMAZING!  If anyone at Amazon reads this please look up who that was and please have her call me?) Agents are hell bound to have you pair. No matter the issue you WILL pair the device. I told them many times my device is paired and that\u2019s not the problem but it falls on deaf ears.  YOU WILL PAIR.  PAIR AGAIN. PAIR AGAIN. PAIR AGAIN.  PAIR AGAIN. Ad nauseam.  The agents only seem trained to do that one thing and if your issue varies from that script they learned in training they have no clue what to do so, PAIR AGAIN! Finally they admit defeat to themselves then they do their best to get you off the phone; by hanging up or just not talking or, giving you some BS about something irrelevant (eg Firestick, ITunes etc.)  They have \u201cno supervisor\u201d or, they claim to be \u201ca supervisor\u201d which is very doubtful when they didn\u2019t even know there even is a 5th generation or do not know that Alexa can turn lights on /off.Back to the hardware, the 5th Gen constantly turns my IPhone Bluetooth off even though it needs it to work.  An unmentioned  \u201cupgrade\u201d I found on the 5th Gen is when you turn the device on you are forced to hear random music from Amazon music which you can not stop or pause until at least 15-20 seconds elapse.  BTW the \u201cupgrade\u201d to the music occurs every time it turns your Bluetooth off and you must turn it back on, which like I said, mine is doing all the time.The 5th Gen also doesn\u2019t seem to hear as well as the 4th Gen did.  At least 50% of the time when asking Alexa a question I get the response  \u201cI\u2019m having trouble hearing\u201d and I\u2019m only 3 feet from her with no background noise.Regarding sound quality, I am a huge music fan and I only hear a very slight improvement over my 4th Gen, not enough to justify upgrading if music quality is your deciding factor IMO; however; my partner hears a big difference so maybe it depends on music genre (Our preferred genres are polar opposites,)I considered that I may have gotten a \u201cdud\u201d or a \u201clemon\u201d device but Amazon refuses to even consider that because they can \u2018see\u2019 the device online, however to me that only shows the WiFi on the Gen 5 works, but not necessarily all the other functions (ie Bluetooth etc.) but it\u2019s my theory vs Amazon.I really want my 5th Gen to work and to love it as I did my Gen 4 but after 3 days and many frustrating calls I think I may return it and go back to my 4th Gen.I think the 5th Gen could be great but it needs more time in beta testing and/or a complete \u201cdo-over\u201d.  IMO I would advise others to wait until a new version of Gen 5 is available or even Gen 6 is available.\n",2 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

I was barefoot on a hard floor so I'm not sure that it was just static electricity. Did I get a wonky one? Quality control is high, but the rare glitch is inevitable, so if so, it's not a big deal.

One buys a dark color when you want to have a speaker that is not so obvious.  Add a white cord and plug to a dark colored speaker????  Beyond ugly and obvious.  I may just end up wrapping black tape around the cord and plug in an effort to hide the glaringly white cord and plug.This device was replacing a Gen 1 Alexa after getting an updated router that could not connect with Gen 1.  The Alexa App is almost useless if there are challenges to hookups.  I spent way too much time trying to get the ""old"" Alexa to work.  The suggestion that eventually made by Alexa herself was to look at app and manually set up Gen 1.  As hard as I looked, I could not find a link that indicated ""manually connect.""  Problem could be solved by indicating that on first page that lists the different Echo/Alexa devices and indicate Gen 1 has a specific and different setup.All that being said, I have come to appreciate having Alexa - setting timers and alarms, notifications for packages, listening to music, etc.  I also like that Alexa is smaller than the original tower Gen. 1 and has similar quality for acoustics.The new Gen 5 Alexa is working much the same as the old one.  I can't hear a difference in sound quality though the older version had good sound quality as well.  Upgrades are inevitable -- just wish the process was easier and less frustrating.

They have come a long way since the original dot. The problem is, who wants to use it when it's main function now  seems to be nothing but playing  Amazon ads.'By the way', Alexa has been a great help to handicapped individuals. Great for everything from turning on lights to operating oven and microwave if blind.I realize Amazon' s  goal is to make a profit.  However commercial creep has become such a problem that it the product is more of an irritation than help to many people. Who wants to be blasted with a 30 second commercial first thing in the morning, when all you wanted was the temperature?I have purchased numerous  MP3 songs and albums from Amazon.  I have been able to play the playlists of music I  purchased from Amazon on the Alexa , also purchased from Amazon, with no interruption.. Recently I thought I would relax with  my playlist of 30 songs , only to find out Amazon  does it  again!  All of a sudden. I  now have to deal with at least  15 very annoying  ""commercial breaks"" in a 30 song list.I will probably go an alternative route for music. Who wants to assault guests in your home to Amazon commercials when all you wanted was to provide some background music?Maybe Amazon should have offered an ad free option at purchase like the Kindle.

Absolutely horrible customer service!,"\nI had 13 of these spread through my home as I wanted music throughout my home.  One day only some worked, so I called customer service to help.  SEVEN hours later, being disconnected 3 times and going through the same \u201cproblem solving\u201d tricks sometimes 4 times, I had fewer working than when I started.  7 no longer did more than tell time.  I asked for them to be replaced given Amazon took 7 hours and made the situation much worse.  I was sent an email that said once I ordered and received 7 new ones (nearly $400) I would be issued a refund.When I didn\u2019t get my refund I called to obtain it.  Amazon refused to honor the email that they themselves sent and could read.  In that sequence I was disconnected and LAUGHED at over my insistence that Amazon honor the email I received.  They refused and weren\u2019t even polite about it.  That series of calls was utterly horrible as they were snotty, arrogant thought this was funny and rude and took and additional hour and a half to get no where.  I would NOT have ordered 7 more of these but for the email saying I was going to be refunded the cost of them.Now they want me to return the ones that don\u2019t work or the new ones though the email makes no notice of my obligation to do more than buy more of them in order to get a refund.  Again the email did not obligate me to return anything.  Nor should I have to after 7 exhausting hours on the phone and I was left worse off after dealing with \u201ccustomer service.\u201dIt will take me 2 hours plus gas to get to a place to return either the new Echos or the damaged ones.  Plus they will keep my money for 2+weeks before refunding my $400.So now I own 20 of these things.  7 don\u2019t work.  7 in a box and I already know that customer support likely will not (given I was worse off having called them) make them function nor will they support their products.  Either in actuality or even politely.  So basically 14 of the 20 I have are useless to me ballpark $800.  Plus by the time I get to returning them IF I can as I don\u2019t have time to get to a UPS store I will have nearly 12 hours in this process and I still will not only have fewer working Echos than when I started but the grief, aggravation and rude treatment I have been subjected to.And given they refuse to honor their own emails on this I have zero hope that they will honor any refund I\u2019m due whether I send the new ones back or the 7 I have that don\u2019t work.  I\u2019ve asked that they contact me to resolve this and they have not!At all times I did EVERYTHING Amazon asked me to do.  Whether it was how to fix what I had or get new ones to fix the problem.  Their support staff is incapable of fixing problems and they DO NOT HONOR their OWN emails.  Making their promise my problems.Stay away!!!!!!\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

After getting nowhere with Amazon support I decided to return the speaker and get another one, hoping that would work better. Still the same issue. When I paired this with the Echo Studio it caused both devices to constantly skip songs, or just shut off entirely. Not just every once in a while, but every other song! When I play music on the Studio alone there is no issue. When I try playing the group with the Dot and the Studio together the Dot messes up both of them. This is obviously an issue with the new Echo Dot that needs to be fixed. Does anyone know of any other device I can pair with my Studio to have surround sound in my clinic? I am giving up on this new Dot. I would not recommend it at all if you plan on pairing it with another device because it will cause both of them to have an issue.I bought this speaker on Black Friday to pair with the echo studio I have at work. I have been attempting to use it for the past three days. It constantly disconnects from the Internet and will stop playing music, then randomly start playing another song. I have performed a factory reset on both devices at least three times, disconnected and reconnected to the Internet, contacted tech-support, and still nothing. It continues to stop playing songs randomly, or skips to another song.I contacted Amazon support, which was abysmal. After spending an hour talking to someone I finally gave up. I want to return this device and get a replacement. They told me they canceled the replacement and cannot send a new echo for some reason. I told them I wanted to return the original and get a replacement product for it. And they told me they canceled the replacement product and could not send one to me. I am very frustrated because I had high hopes for this new model. The sound quality was decent, but the connectivity was terrible. It disconnected from the Internet every 5 to 10 minutes and I would have to go back into the Alexa app to start playing music again. Even though I paired it with the studio, it would not let me control the devices in the group that I created. I was hoping that maybe there was just a glitch with the one I received and a new one would work better. But apparently the replacement was canceled and they cannot send a new one for some unknown reason. So I will have to go back and buy it at double the price because it is no longer black Friday. So that is frustrating.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only

The Alexa says it is successfully connected to my network, but time after time, it fails to do anything.On a regular day, Alexa either understands what I'm saying clearly, or misses every other word. It seems to change by the hour. I understand hearing the wrong synonym, but it would frequently start responding to things nowhere near what I had asked.If you want a smart device, you're better off sticking with Google.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

But she has started to get some use out of it for music lately. I hate that she cant just pick music she wants to hear. She asks for a song amd it just advertises again and again sometimes about ways she could hear tge song she wants for a subscription to something extra every month. I mean we got Prime and we have the Alexa now along with a thousand amazon purchases each year. So why cant it just play the song she wants from the 60s without me having to add another 20 dollars in fees each month. We tried to just oay tye unlimted music plan to get it for her. But then amazon said, no you gotta have a seperate monthly fee to use your subscription on the alexa device. I mean the T.V. can play the unlimited music app, and my our phones. I can stream it to the home speaker system too and ask alexa on my phone to stream it to the speakers and it works. But my grandma cant do all that extra nonsense. She just wants to hear her songs and wants it to answer 2 questions a week about the weather. And it wont do that unless you pay for an additional service for that 1 device? Seems like a failure on Amazons' part in my opinion. Just saying. Maybe try and stop nickel and diming for digital content when were in a recession. Music of all things from the old days shouldnt be something you bogard or monopolize on. Just my opinion.\n",3 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

The sound quality is very good in my home office setting. The biggest thing to think about when buying is are you planning to listen to music all day or leaving it on for the dog while you step out? The problem is Alexa will turn off due to inactivity at random, sometimes 15 minutes, sometimes over an hour after it starts playing. I don't care to have a conversation with Alexa every 15 minutes to keep it from shutting down so a radio might be a better option. Another thing is connecting a blue tooth speaker. It is not possible for the Echo Dot 5th generation internal speaker to be on at the same time you have a paired speaker such as my Bose speaker on in another room. The only work around to having music throughout the house is to buy an Echo Dot for wherever you want music, but then you will still be dealing with the shutting down issue due to inactivity.

I turned off the extender function so now I just have an over priced Dot.  The reason I turned off the extender is that I discovered that the speed limitation on the extender is 100mb.  I have 1g service and the extender was causing my Eero system to lag and grind.  C\u2019mon Amazon\u2026..This is a bad deal.  You can and should do better, both in tech and in disclosure.Previous review-When I saw Amazon was coming out with a Dot that could serve as an extender for my Eero setup I jumped on it.  What a great idea.  Amazon has done a great job with Alexa products.  They have gotten easier and easier to set up, and in general they work really well.  This 5th Gen Dot also works well but the extender feature had a few wrinkles.  First, when I initially tried to activate the extender feature it immediately popped up an error message which told me I needed to download and update.  That was odd given I preordered the device and have to believe I am one of the first shipments to go out.  No big thing.  I asked Alexa to update the software and in about 30 minutes it was done.  But then, it still balked when I tried to activate the extender.  Same error message.  I asked Alexa to check for updates again, but she said it was up to date.  I tried a few more times, waited a little while, and it finally connected to the Eero system.  However, it then kept cutting in and out.  It was really unstable.  For whatever tech gremlin reason, it finally seems to have settled in and has been holding on to a WiFi signal for a while.  As is often the case with tech, I expect there will be some additional updates.  We'll see.  We'll also wait and see if this thing does, in fact, work well with the Eero system.  If it doesn't, no big thing.  You can turn that feature off and just use it as a normal Dot.  But I hope it does settle in and work well, because I do think it's a great idea and really nice feature.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only

After Amazon laid off 10k people, most of whom were on the Alexa team, the quality of Alexa has dropped enormously! I think Amazon also shut off a bunch of servers to reduce cost as well, which is the only thing I can think of for the sudden reduced quality. I have searched the internet and have found that a lot of people are having the same issues as me in the last month. Most of the issues that have recently popped up are:1. Roughly half of the time, Alexa can take a very long time to answer. It is somewhere between 5 and 10 seconds.2. Many times I have to ask Alexa multiple times for it to actually respond.3. Most of the time, the response has nothing at all to do with the question asked so I have to rephrase the question. Sometimes it takes three to five times to rephrase the question. If after the fifth time it doesn't work, I just give up.4. If you own multiple Alexas, there has always been a problem of asking Alexa a question, and it responds on a completely different Alexa. It seems to have gotten much worse lately.I feel like Amazon has given up on Alexa, so it is a sinking ship. I am looking at what other product I can use to replace it with, but am hesitant to go with the other two major brands because they could decide to do the same thing at any point.

I bought this newest version for only one reason: the Room Temperature Sensor.Here in New England, my kitchen is always slightly colder than the rest of downstairs. I could have bought a Nest Sensor, but replacing my kitchen fit with this version would make it a multi-tasker.Except - IT DOESN'T WORK. It reads 56F constantly. The room, measured by any other thermometer is actually 64F.When I called Echo support, they told me they've received *many* complaints about this, and were just sending out replacements. Sure enough, a new dot arrived the next day. Set it up, waited 24 hours, and.... 56F!Amazon, this was a great idea. Really. Great. But the execution simply doesn't work. True, the sound is nicer than my other dots - and if I were using it as a music speaker That might prove useful.

The sound is way better for one, BUT it is also a totally redundant piece of junk at the same time, unless you want to invest $120/year to make it worthwhile, which also makes it one of the worst investments you can make.Allow me to explain something which many people already have already realised: A lot of people use this for kitchen timers, weather reports and maybe the occasional fact from Wikipedia, but most people who buy this will want it for an upgrade for sound quality for Amazon Music, and this is where I consider this thing junk.Without any consultation, Amazon have decided to allow normal Prime users full access to the WHOLE 10 (or is it 100?) million song library, with a small catch. You can no longer listen to what you ACTUALLY want to listen to, you have to listen to a shuffle of 1 or 2 songs you want to hear, plus all the random junk in that 10/100 million playlist, and that's a lot of junk.You can no longer listen to your albums you bought WITHOUT shuffle, you can no longer listen to ANY album without shuffle, and you now have to listen to totally random nonsense too. If you used to use Alexa to give your kids a lullaby to go to sleep, they might also get some Sex Pistols mixed in. Sweet Dreams !!UNLESS, you upgrade to unlimited - only $120/year - some would consider that a bargain for a peaceful nights sleep, but considering it was part of Prime but is now locked behind a paywall, I personally have a different view.1 star is all you're getting for this blatant money-grab and betrayal of customer trust !\n",33 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

The 5th gen has some things you might want, like temperature sensor or the ability for it to tell when you enter a room (though that's a bit creepy - can we opt-out of that data collection?).

The voice recognition is downright terrible, often you have to yell at it because if you have the volume up louder than 4(goes to 10), it can't hear you over it's own audio, you have to stand right in front of the device and yell at it to get it to listen to you. Google doesn't have this issue, you can whisper to Google while it's at full volume from across the room, and it will still hear you.If you have more than one device integrated into your home, be prepared to expect commands worse than talking to a toddler. I have a speaker in my kitchen, and one in my living room. If I want to pause amazon music in the kitchen after cooking, and transfer the music over to my living room to eat, forget it. I've only gotten this feature to ever work twice, all the other times, it will revert to whatever music was played last on that particular speaker.In short, I'm completely baffled as to why Amazon doesn't invest more time into these smart speakers, they could be phenomenal, but, instead Amazon only invests money on the data mining aspect of the devices, as Alexa is CONSTANTLY making suggestions of what you should buy on Amazon, ex: you are talking about dishes with a friend in your house, MAGICALLY suggested Amazon purchases are a bunch of dishes on your phone/computer. I 100% honestly wouldn't even care about this complete invasion of privacy, if the devices actually worked somewhat okay. The one and only reason we've kept them is because they were a wedding gift, and that's pretty much it, they suck.

Now I'm sorry I did.  After the recent Alexa ""upgrade,"" Amazon devices will no longer play albums or playlists of music that HAS BEEN PURCHASED FROM AMAZON. All that work creating playlists of music for relaxation, sleep, exercise, and favorite artists in various groupings, all of that is suddenly GONE from the Alexa service. Likewise, if one requests to hear an album that is in MY library purchased from Amazon, she insists on saying that she is going to shuffle other music by ""similar artists"" along with my albums that I DO NOT want to listen to and ignores my playlists completely. Mind you, these are requests for music purchased from Amazon. Just saying that again so it's clear. Then, when making a music request, Alexa frequently makes one listen to long ads for buying her expensive music service . You know, if you request to hear your music, you really want to hear that and not the same annoying ad you've heard a million times about a product you will never buy, and then some random music you didn't request. I loved being able to listen to my music just by asking for it and have purchased Echo devices for almost every room in the house. Now that I can't do that anymore, all those hardware and music purchases seem very much like bait-and-switch to me and I feel very ripped off.  Now I would feel bad about buying this as a gift, since I assume it would have the same sad behavior I experience at home and just provide irritation.

When I called the customer service number for Vizio I was told that a ""voice-activated"" remote control was not supplied with our model (even though it physically is shown on the TV set-up instructions, both printed and on screen), and instead we had to use (PURCHASE) an Echo Dot to communicate with the TV for search and voice-activated purposes on the TV.Thirty extra dollars (wasted) later, Vizio's response appears to have been a complete lie on their part. Turns out that the voice recognition, sound quality, and Wi-Fi signal for the Echo Dot, itself,  is totally useless for coordinating commands with  our new Vizeo TV.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

This is just FACT. New dot = no AUX port. No AUX port = no easy link to your older entertainment center. Even with the fire sticks. I returned a 4k model and a 4k max model... I use their older firestick that would be listed as their 3rd release regular firestick that supports the simple 1080pm format. They even work better on my 4k tv. Only difference is the half gb extra storage which doesn't matter to me. 1.5 and 1. No difference.. Oh and the volt cord is white! Yes white, On a black device. So tacky looking like why?? If I wasn't sending This back I would of used a black volt cord I already had. No AUX port and white corded?? On a black echo dot? Hideous! Amazon is really acting up. Throwing this stuff together and asking high prices \U0001f914.. Need to add the older dots Can be connected with a 3.5 headphone jack as well not just the  L.R. RCA to AUX . You can use the 3.5 jack to connect The DOT to a entertainment system or louder speaker via 3.5. duel ended regular Jack. I just hooked 1 of my firesticks directly into the receivers HDMI ARC, stereo system as well seems to sound much better along with the DOT which You CANT do with this 5th generation Echo.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
