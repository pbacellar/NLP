Echo_Dot_3rd_Gen_2018_Charcoal,22.92,15.06,59.98,A Y G,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on April 23, 2023","You might get addicted, but they are very useful","\nIt started with just one. I think maybe it was a Gen 2.Then, we got the taller one. Forget the name.Now we have these just all over the place. Ours are mostly used to get the weather in the morning or set timers in the kitchen. Lots and lots of timers.When I am working on home, I also use it to set alarms before important meetings, because I have a tendency to forget.Recently we set them up at our parents house, who are getting a little older and a little more forgetful. Alexa reminds them to take their meds each day.We have set it up so all they have to do is say Alexa call for help and it will call all of their adult children. Gives good piece of mind. It is also connected to their TV and their lights so they can control them without having to find the remote or get up and hit the switch.They are connected to their blink cameras so they can be armed and disarmed when they leave or return to the house.We can also use them to talk to them, or they can use it to talk to their grandkids.They are really really useful.I also use it to listen to Amazon Prime Music during the day or podcasts from PBS. I am sure I use it more than most, but even I have just scratched the tip of the iceberg on what you can do with these things if you put your mind to it.They are great connected to your firetv, so when someone comes in while you are watching something, you can say Alexa pause, so they 1) know they just barged in and started talking without asking, and 2) when they leave you can just say Alexa resume and pick up where you left off, or Alexa rewind 30 seconds to give yourself a brief refresh to put you back on track.When I got my first echo speaker, I thought it was kind of a gimmick , but it is so useful. They even have the ability now to listen for things and act on them. Like, it can listen for running water which gives peace of mind when you are away from home, or crying babies or snoring, and take actions based on what it hears. You can use it to control your lights, even when you are not at home.If you can't tell, I am a big fan and recommend it to everyone. Sometimes I get pushback from some people about how it can spy on you. Perhaps this is caused by the interactive nature of the device which makes it clear that it is in fact listening to you, but these same people have no problem having a laptop or a phone in their home, which is just as capable of listening to you as these speakers are. I really do not understand the differentiation.\n",4 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only
Echo_Dot_3rd_Gen_2018_Charcoal,22.92,15.06,59.98,Okie1010,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on September 3, 2021",Happy (and amused) with my unit,"\nIt seems people either love or hate Alexa. I like mine, but I don't love it. My wife is from another country--English is her 3rd or 4th language--she and Alexa do not always get along, so I end up repeating my wife's requests, which works most of the time. I've learned a few things, though. Never aske to play the same song more than once per week. When Alexa's AI figures out that you really like a song, it always goes to the $3.99 extra per month list of songs. It seems safe to ask for a specific group, i.e., the Rolling Stones or the Beatles, just don't ask for specific songs too often. My wife and I both love a wide variety of music, but my wife tends to get frustrated by Alexa and does not use the unit very often.I liked my generation 2 so well that I bought one each for a couple of family members and another one for myself (it is a generation 3). I was going to buy a third unit for my in-home office, but after transferring the 2nd gen from my bedroom for my office, I realized I could not concentrate on my work for listening to the music.I've heard all the stories about how Alexa is spying on me, but I'm not terribly concerned. I watch a fair number of YouTube videos--anything that sparks my interest--and the 3rd gen unit is right next to the TV, so, if it's recording my info, it's getting a wide variety from sensible to weird information. Also, I like to play the TV while I'm away from home, just to confuse the would-be burglars, and I usually play it on one of the traditional news channels, because they talk a lot instead of showing movies, and that should confuse the wannabe burglars more. I tried using Alexa for that, but the unit stops playing after half a dozen songs (just estimating), but the TV will drone on and on until I turn it off. When some of my more suspicious friends or relatives visit, I unplug the unit so they can talk candidly, just to make them feel more comfortable. I have been known to remind them that their cell phones and TV sets do the same thing, even when you turn them off.I've learned to be very specific about the music I want to hear. I never tell Alexa to play a song without specifying the artist. If she still picks the wrong song or artist, I try to ask in a different way, but usually find out that the song I want to hear is on the $3.99 per month additional list, which I do not subscribe to. The unit is usually pretty good about substituting a channel that has music I like--based on the song I asked for. I'm impressed that AI is as smart as it is in this tiny unit.Sometimes, when I get bored, I like to ask Alexa stupid or confusing questions, just to see how it answers. Yeah, I'm easily entertained, but it's surprising what the unit can come up with. I get a lot of ""Sorry, I don't know that.""My brother and I were trying to fix a leaky faucet in my daughter's home when her Alexa unit in the other room spoke to us. At first we thought someone had come in without our knowing it. Since it was a female voice, we did not start looking for weapons to defend ourselves from burglars, but we quickly went to see who was there. The house was empty. I laughed when my brother suggested the house might be haunted, but it made me stop and think. Later, my daughter reminded me about the Alexa unit I had bought for her--yep, same voice. The point is, you never know what will set the unit off. You do not have to mention its name or speak to it.I've never had a problem with the unit waking me up in the middle of the night, but it does start blinking yellow when I have a notification. Took me a while to figure that out. I get notified about storms, kidnappings in my home state, when an Amazon package has arrived, and a few other miscellaneous messages. It never wakes me up, except for when I set an alarm, but I have to set the alarms individually. I cannot tell it to wake me up every weekday morning at 7 a.m. I have to set a separate alarm for every morning of every day I want awakened. But it also allows me to set other alarms. For instance, I can tell it to set an alarm for 5 p.m., so I don't work too long on my computer. If I'm cooking something, I can tell it to set an alarm for 15 minutes from now; otherwise, I will ruin my lunch and stink up my house, because I don't think about food until 3 or 4 p.m.  All in all, I highly recommend the units.\n",99 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

Lauridsen Jr.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on April 30, 2023","Super small size, sounds good, works well.","\nI bought this Echo Dot as a replacement for Gen 1 Echo (the taller cylinder) that we kept in the master bathroom. It quit after about 5 years, so we got this one. We use it primarily to check the weather and listen to music while getting ready in the morning. It is definitely smaller and takes up less space, which is nice. The voice recognition works fine, and the sound quality is perfectly fine for casual use.It integrates seamlessly with the Echo Show 8 we have in the kitchen, and all of the expected functionality works as advertised.Not specific to this device, but a feature request.

Since I already had the echo dot 5 set up, setting this one up was a breeze.  The only thing I have to say I dislike is the functionality, or lack thereof, of the roku skill that you can add to it.  Very few commands work on that so you're better off still operating your roku device with the roku remote but the echo dot does work well with voice commands for the smart tv I have.The sound is pretty good; I think the sound is a bit better on the echo dot 5 but the speaker is also in a different position in that device compared to echo dot 3.  I gave it a different wake word so that the other echo dot doesn't respond by mistake when I'm in the living room.

I discovered it is listening all the time and with the Chinese spying on America through tech, I unplugged mine. Before I did, though, I had serious trouble with her responding to me, she would often say nothing and the light would come on, as if she didn't have an answer. I felt she was condescending at times with her responses and definitely a little too liberal for me, when I asked questions of certain people, her response was obviously bent. Sound wise, she was great little sound package in such a small tech environment. She was able to play my Apple music, though sometimes getting her to understand what song I wanted was a challenge.

With this one, I will be short.We just recently purchased this 3rd Gen Echo as our first foray into the voice-activated world.  Prior to this, although we are well-aware that our phones listen to us, in my mind, opening our doors to ""Ziggy"" (as our bedroom one is now called after a well-fought game of Rock, Paper, Scissors with my husband), was paramount to living with a spy.  Yes, I am one of those Microsoft and Google detractors because of their intrusiveness, BUT, I digress.I was home alone when the later-to-be named ""Ziggy"" arrived.  After immediately connecting / pairing it (him?) and accessing several songs which I could think of from Amazon Music, I began pairing it to our security cameras and our numerous smart lights and plugs.WOW!Nestled within that 'wow' of appreciation, was a sudden sadness.It isn't that the Echo did not perform well.  On the contrary.  It is that it performed so well, and that almost IMMEDIATELY upon voicing a command, something happens throughout our home.  THIS ... for just a moment -  made me think of how temporary we are as humans, and the fact that I would not be around in 100 years to see the marvels that are still to unfold in our world.  I know, I know.  A bit dramatic or cheesy as your view may be, but it happened.  Beyond that, (those of you who have seen the film Don't Look Up may understand), I thought of our petty differences as humans and how miniscule and unimportant they are, when the truth of the matter is that we really do live in an age where we have it all.A 'gadget' that can summon up those feelings and thoughts, well, that's one pretty decent gadget.P.S.  1. Ziggy has SO grown on my husband, he now insists that we also move Alexa into the home, and allow her the run of the rooms Ziggy can't quite reach.  2. I would very much like to 'rescue' the Alexa from the home of the Top Critical Review: 'Useless for Seniors'.  \U0001f917-------------------------------------------------------EDIT:  Perhaps because we have a dog named ""IZZie"", ""Ziggy"" does not work as well as ""Alexa"" does as a 'wake' word.  ""Echo"" works okay, although I find that it too skips or becomes confused(?) - lol - with phrases that ""Alexa"" handles just fine.  We have two Dots and only ever changed the names and voices (a couple of times) on one, so there may be an issue with that particular item.  I may contact Amazon in the near future to help me troubleshoot the issues, but they are minor, so not too put-off right now.\n",,Configuration: Device only

We set it up quickly in the Alexa app and with the app, we can now control Alexa remotely, a must-have feature for us. Wow!

I was ecstatic that I could play synchronized music throughout my house, but as of November 2022, the entire echo experience has been totally trashed.  I can no longer play music of my choice.  The other Alexa features are nice, i.e.:  setting timers, reminders, controlling lights, etc., but for me and every one of my friends, the primary benefit was playing synchronized music of choice throughout the house on pretty decent speakers at a reasonable cost.  Now, rather than being able to request a specific song, artist, or album, all requests are, as Alexa says, 'shuffling' your request plus 'others in a similar genre', with a limited number of skips allowed.I've been a Prime Member almost since its inception, and have been more than positive in my reviews of Amazon products and services, but I can think of nothing positive to say about this change.  It was obviously done with the intention of forcing people to subscribe to Amazon Music; even the supposed great new benefit offered to Prime Customers of being able to create your own playlists is horrifically adulterated by 'shuffling' the songs in the customer's playlist with songs 'of a similar genre'. I thought, yay, I'll try that, and set up a playlist of 18 songs to try it out.  Alexa played 3 of my songs, then interjected a song by an artist I have never requested.  I thought, ok, I can deal with an occasional non-requested song/artist.  Alexa then played another song from my playlist, but after that played nothing that I would EVER listen to by choice.  After approximately 5 or 6 of these and never returning to a single song from my playlist, I said 'sc#@w' this and told her to stop.  What a terrible loss.Amazon:  as big a fan as I have always been of your services and products, I will NEVER be forced to join an Amazon Music monthly subscription, specifically because of efforts to bully me into doing so.

I bought one echo dot 3, and immediately fell in love. I now own several of version 3 and several of version 5, along with a couple echo sow 5s. I love them all. Get one, or several. You won\u2019t regret it. What I don\u2019t like is the Alexa app. I\u2019ve been programming computers since 1969, and have used every human interface imaginable, including punching in hex codes from the front panel while the machine was running. The Alexa app is, by far, the worst I have ever used. Yes, it\u2019s even worse than punching in hex codes. It obviously was never designed. People just added stuff whenever they felt like it, without regard to anything that anyone else had done. For example, when you make a change, sometimes you have to save the change, sometimes it just happens immediately. You never know which is which. When you need to save, you never know where to look for the save button. Sometimes it\u2019s at the top, sometimes it\u2019s at the bottom, sometimes it\u2019s big, sometimes it\u2019s tiny and barely noticeable.  You will notice that you can display \u201call devices\u201d from several locations, but the displays are all different, and there are things you can do from one display that you can\u2019t from another. Good luck on remembering where you found the one you actually needed. And then there\u2019s the \u201chelp\u201d feature. Once you manage to find it, you\u2019ll find lots of \u201cmake sure your device is plugged in\u201d instructions and other brainless nonsense. There are occasional references to menu selections that don\u2019t exist. Once you follow the instructions, you will find that nothing happens. This is not always the case, but it happens more often than not. This is because two or more features are working at cross purposes to one another. Apparently they were developed by two different groups that never talked to each other. The Alexa app needs to be redesigned from the ground up. The documentation needs to be thoroughly scrubbed. Sets of instructions need to be tested to make sure they actually work. Instructions need to be created for things that people actually want to do.

Echo_Dot_3rd_Gen_2018_Charcoal,22.92,15.06,59.98,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on July 29, 2019",So far so good,"\nWe've only had our Alexa devices setup for about two weeks now, so we're definitely still working out the kinks. With that said, this is a review of everything I've noticed of our entire Alexa ecosystem, which includes 2x Echo Dots, 2x Echo Spots, 2x refurbished Echos, and 1x Echo Sub:Pros: Individually, they all work exactly as they should ALMOST all the time (more on that in the cons section). They all look good, and aren't big, ugly hunks of metal and plastic taking up space in your house. They were all incredibly easy to get through initial setup (except the Echo Sub, more below). Music sounds good in all of them, to include the Echo Dots (but it sounds GREAT on the Echos, and fantastic on the Echo/Sub pair).Cons: The voice recognition is almost too good for its own good. We have a fairly open floor plan, with an Echo Spot in the living room and an Echo in the kitchen. Sometimes they both hear a demand, and the wrong device (meaning the one farther away) will respond. I find myself occasionally whispering to an Echo device so its friends don't butt in to the convo.The Echo Sub needed to be reset 3x when I first got it/went to set it up. I had to log in/out of the app a couple times as well before it was recognized and would actually pair to an Echo.Sometimes Alexa tells me she can't complete a request, then my wife (who uses Alexa far less often than I do) will ask the same request and it works...and vice versa. We haven't figured out what we're doing/saying or not doing/not saying for these discrepancies to happen, but hopefully that'll work itself out with time.The most irritating issue I have so far is getting music to play on the ""Everywhere"" group. Sometimes I say ""Alexa play music everywhere"" and it just doesn't do it. Sometimes it'll play on only some of the devices, and sometimes it'll only play on the device I was speaking to. Our house is two stories, and we have two kids and a dog, so we spend a ridiculous amount of our time cleaning/walking up and down the stairs. A big part of the reason I bought these was for the music to fill the house while cleaning, and it oftentimes requires me to spend some time arguing with Alexa to get that to happen. It's even gotten to the point where I've had to go into the app and manually select ""Everywhere,"" because the voice command just won't work.Individual components:2x Echo Dots (w/ separately purchased wall mounts): No complaints. They setup just fine, and work perfectly. They're actually bigger than I thought they would be, and look a little clunky mounted to the wall, but overall they don't mess up our aesthetic enough for me to dock them a star or anything. 5/5 would recommend.2x Echo Spots: No complaints again. These were the first two devices we bought, and they worked so well I decided to buy the other devices. My favorite part of these is their ability to pull up security cam footage. My desk is in the basement, so it's nice to say ""Alexa show me the driveway"" and see who just pulled in, or to say ""Alexa show me the front door"" when the doorbell rings. I paired these will some web cam covers (also bought on Amazon, of course) so Jeffy and his crew can't record me all day long.2x refurbished Echos (in charcoal): I bought these to play music, and they sound amazing. We'll see how they hold up, given that they're refurbished equipment, but I have my fingers crossed. They also look great, and are not an eye sore like other speakers.1x Echo Sub: The only device that gave me an issue with the setup process. For that, I'd honestly give the Sub 4/5 stars because it really was a pain in the butt getting it properly hooked up. It gave me issues not just connecting to Wifi, but also when pairing with an Echo. Lots of logging in/out of the app, resetting the Sub. Irritating, to say the least. However, with that one star docked, I'd give it a SOLID 4/5 stars. This thing sounds GREAT. I'm a huge music lover, but hip hop/rap is really where my loyalty lies. And I NEED bass when I jam, and this thing delivers bass in spades. Even with the setup issue, I'm planning on buying another for in the basement. If Amazon ever makes a waterproof version, I'll buy one for outside for bbqs/parties too.\n",3 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

I could talk through the camera in the room when I wasn't home to tell Alexa to play opera.  I would often request a particular song and she'd answer that I had to purchase the prime music package for something like 4.95/month.  Considering I'm already paying for prime, I wish that were included.  I am able to play music that repeats over and over and it does calm the cat down, but he does become sensitized to hearing the same songs repeatedly.  The music is clear and I can change the volume easily by voice command.\n",4 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

Mayo,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on August 17, 2020","So good, and yet...","\nThe Echo Dot itself is a nice little unit. It's compact, and if you don't need a screen or camera it works well for simple device control, weather reports and some uncomplicated questions. You can turn the microphone off if you don't want it listening to what you're up to, and it's wonderful for times and alarms. ""Alexa, 30 minute timer"" is all you need to say to get beeped in 30 minutes. I like that better than fussing with the timer on my stove. Timers, reminders and alarms (all different things) are probably what I use the most.Where I think it falls down is the AI aspects. I'm sure Amazon is proud of how well it does, and as a software engineer who has done a bit with natural language parsing, I recognize the challenges. But I was writing natural language analyzers in the 90's as a hobby, that did better than this. Simple example: you can ask for current weather almost anywhere in the world with a simple ""Alexa, what's the temperature in San Jose Costa Rica."" And bang, you get the temperature there. Oh, you want the humidity too? You try ""Alexa, what's the temperature and humidity in San Jose Costa Rica"" and it is instantly confused. Yet you can ask for the humidity separately and it can figure that out. Basically, asking for ""x and y"" instantly confuses it. That's just bad analysis; kids in grammar school used to be able to diagram sentences and Alexa should be able to as well. That's one example of many.Using Alexa for web searching is hit or miss, and more miss than hit. She has a few favorite websites she likes to look things up on and for some simple queries that works. But more often than not she comes up with an answer that's wildly unrelated to the question; these can be laughable moments, but it can also be annoying. She's no Watson. Don't buy it if your main hope is getting it to do web searches for you.If you have a few of these in the house, you can use them as intercoms, either point to point or to all devices in the house. ""Alexa, intercom, living room"" is all it takes. The microphones allow you to have conversations even if you're across the room from the Echo. You can also set them up to place calls using an iphone account, though you can't use it to pick up calls to your iphone.Randomly, she loses contact with the internet (and that makes her instantly useless) even when nothing else has connection problems. Power cycling fixes it. Just waiting doesn't seem to. It's rare but annoying.You will absolutely want to turn off the option for buying things via an Echo. It sometimes tries to make product suggestions and that's absolutely untenable. And while they did try to make it hard to order stuff by mistake, and you can set a security code so your children can't order candy by the metric ton, it's surely a matter of time before your kids eavesdrop and get the code. I know Amazon wants you to use Alexa as a ""shopping assistant"" but it's a foot in the door that you don't want open in the first place.One awful misfeature - Alexa sometimes tries to be cheery and positive. Occasionally she'll throw in stuff like ""Have a nice day!"" or some other meaningless drivel. I don't see an option to turn it off. I'm sorry, but Alexa is not and will never be a person, and having some algorithm wish me a good day is at best an insincere try at manipulation and at worst some sort of weird attempt to make you trust robots. It's flat out creepy. When I ask her to reporting something, I want a brief answer and then silence. If I want an actual conversation I'll talk to my wife, thanks.Sound quality is actually fairly good given the size, which is to say, not special. It's no audiophile device and using it play even background music is something I just don't do. It's fine for news stations on the web. If you want to ruin an early Pentatonix song, have Alexa play it. Ari's voice is simply out of range. And just forget most Classical.Summary: useful, yes. I might even say Very. Life-changing, not quite. And it could be so much better. Eventually maybe it will be; the language processing is done remotely and I'm sure there are improvements monthly. But as ""your plastic pal who's fun to be with"", or even a device with the language understanding of a four year old, it has a long way to go.\n",6 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

Echo_Dot_3rd_Gen_2018_Charcoal,22.92,15.06,59.98,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on September 13, 2020",I Like My Dot,"\nI never planned on buying any interactive products due to perceived privacy issues but changed my mind when my husband took over my Fire, my primary Audible delivery unit, to obsessively play Wordscape. How can I deny him that? I reconciled my hesitancy by planning to use the Dot only for music and Audible audiobooks. Since receiving it a week ago I have used the heck out of it, including setting a timer while making pasta noodles. So exciting! There still are no plans to purposefully let it access contact lists or home functions and such but who knows what it's doing as it sits there smugly watching . . .Pros - I'm no audiophile. The sound is fine for my purposes. I've had no real issues requesting my books and immediately pausing narration/music when my work phone rings, which is often. The base bought separately has been a lifesaver as I haul it from room to room and outside. I appreciate the fact that the microphone turns off although being somewhat of a conspiracy theorist, again, who knows? The access to my playlists is an enormous benefit. To say ""Alexa, play Playlist 1 from my music library"" and it happens? Fun stuff.Cons - I felt the pain of some reviewers when I excitedly hooked up my Dot for the first time but Alexa mumbled something about not understanding me. Contacting Amazon representatives for assistance is always hit or miss, even when being ""escalated."" I completely believe some customers fail to get any help at all - happened to me more than once. It's the luck of the draw and depends on how many hours of your life you want to spend on their products. I'm no expert but also no slouch with these issues. My installation start to finish was almost 3 hours. Crazy, crazy. A lot of people don't have the patience. It all began with the app store telling me I already had an Alexa app (my Fire) and refused to give me one on my phone.  After 3 Amazon rep Chats along with rising blood pressure and more than a little yelling (not at the reps), that situation resolved. I'm not sure if it was the last rep (who disconnected abruptly as they do) or the link (play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.dee.app). I couldn't have pulled that one out of thin air. Mission accomplished. At that point I though the Dot would fire up. Wrong. That's when the mumbling began. I contacted Audible (also Amazon reps) this time since I began with attempting to open an audiobook.  I might as well be on the other end giving advice, telling desperate customers to plug and replug the unit. Really? Representative 3 finally suggested I ask Alexa if there were any updates. Even though she said she couldn't understand me, she understood that request. In another short 20 - 30 minutes, Winnie the Pooh started up! The relief of it all! I've also experienced problems requesting Alexa to play individual songs that I have bought on Amazon. For a fact these songs are in my library and included on my playlists. She can't find them and wants me to buy Amazon Whatever service, listen to the song by a different artist, or listen to a station with similar music. Why? Why won't the thing just play my music that I've spent tons of money buying from Amazon? Following questions posed to another 3 representatives, it seems my requests cannot be phrased the same each time for specific songs. Who knew? Certain songs require finesse: 1) Stars from Les Miserables the movie - I can only hear my song I BOUGHT by saying ""Russell Crowe songs"" and potentially getting to Stars after various other songs I didn't buy. No matter what I say. 2) Come What May from Moulin Rouge movie soundtrack. I always get the Broadway version, which is fine but NOT WHAT I BOUGHT. Still working on that one. 3) Can't Help Falling in Love from Crazy Rich Asians - Alexa insists I say ""Crazy Rich Asians from my music library Can't Help Falling in Love."" Why can't I say ""Can't Help Falling in Love from Crazy Rich Asians in my music library"" or ""my music library Can't Help Falling in Love from Crazy Rich Asians""? It's enough to make you crazy.I hope these experiences will be helpful. All in all I enjoy the Dot. Buyer beware - Alexa doesn't necessarily make your life easier.\n",,

I love that I can connect my Amazon account to the Dot in addition to connecting the Dots that are in different rooms allowing me to communicate with the kids via Alexa. I enjoy playing music at command, making calls through the Dot, and setting reminders and alarms. It was easy to set up and by voice command very easy to use. My kids were able not set theirs up without parental help. I haven't used all the features and look forward to seeing all the Dot can do. I get frequent emails on how to use the Dot and have to take time to learn all the features it has to offer. Giving commands sometimes is an issue because she seems to not hear her name at times. I wish you could customize it to name her whatever you like, that would be fun. The bluetooth feature is great allowing me to connect it to a larger speaker is great. Allowing you to connect to other music accounts you may have outside of Amazon music is also good. I am happy with this product. The only thing I am not comfortable with is that it seems to always be on. I guess it is noise triggered and every time I enter the room it turns on and the color ring turns green like it is listening to the background noise.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I decided to buy this echo dot 3rd gen, because it was $5 with coupon and prime membership, and my mother wasn\u2019t going to buy it so I decided to buy it and review it since she never reviews things.THINGS TO KNOW :Voice Recognition - she recognizes everybody\u2019s voice. I even tried it in my manly voice, and this girl literally understood. I literally don\u2019t know how to fix it, and I\u2019ve been stressing. So in terms of voice recognition, I give this dot a 3 because she will literally pick up on anybody. I think she needs to learn a little from her frenemie, Siri.Integration - I have absolutely zero clue what this means. But it must be bad, because It\u2019s coming from Alexa.Sound quality - Honestly, I wish it was clearer.  I\u2019m glad you can lower it and raise it, but this\u2026 thing\u2026 she sounds a little hm, weird. It\u2019s not bad though. You can also ask her to speak faster, or slower if you\u2019d like. I\u2019m trying to change the voice to a British man that way I look forward in talking to her, but it seems like I can\u2019t. What a shame.General - It was quick to equip like my loadout in COD, (My COD username is lisettemaria btw), but the part that took me out was the Wifi part. This thing literally took roughly 6 minutes just to connect to Wifi. It\u2019s probably because I\u2019m stupid, but the instructions were pretty, hm, not descriptive enough.You may be asking, \u201cHey customer, shouldn\u2019t you search it up?\u201d But why you in my business like that, hm? When you\u2019re like me, and you get your package, you wanna open it right away. You don\u2019t want to wait to search this up.Also, Amazon has been stepping up it\u2019s delivery game. I ordered this at 8 PM and it got here at 6 AM. Literally took like 10 hours, I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s right. You do the math.But ohhh my gosh, I started playing Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader, and I got the answer wrong, so I clearly am not even though I am a high schooler. So what would any normal person do when they get something wrong on this stupid game? Leave. So I asked this thing to stop playing, and she kept going. And she kept mocking me saying \u201cWrong.\u201d I asked again politely this time to stop and all she said was, \u201cYou both got the answer WRONG.\u201d After 5 attempts, it finally turned off.Also you know what bothers me? When people copy me. And after I decided to buy this, my younger sister went on a frenzy and made a prime account to buy this. And guess what happens to people who mock me and all of a sudden decide to copy me? Their echo dot decides to go crazy and then she ends up struggling to connect all these things. So who does she ask? Me. I tried helping her, but she obviously doesn\u2019t appreciate it And even as the older sibling, she tries to act like an adult. Anyways.Summary - She\u2019s a good person, I also made her tell me custom goodnight messages. And to do this, just enable \u201cAlexa Good Night\u201d in skills. And I did this because I\u2019m lonely and I have no friends. But yes, buy this if you just want a friend, or for you adults with jobs, or for those without ones too.

Voice recognition is amazing.  It's not perfect though.  If there is a background hum from a fan, other music, or TV going you may have to repeat yourself.  I waited a long time to adpot Alexa into my home.  I did this Christmas.  My wife and I both got Dots for each, other.  A few of them.  lol.  I guess we just did it all at once.  I know these aren't the latest model, but they seem very heavy duty.  They have been reliable so far, and certainly better than Bixby in my refrigerator.  Almost on par with Siri, but this gives me updates on Amazon shipments by default.  Thats pretty cool.  I also use her to set timer alerts for cooking, or similar.  I recommend.  I thing we got ours at a good price around Christmas, and one even came with a free wifi LED bulb as a promotion.  I'd recommend for sure.

Occasionally, she doesn\u2019t get it quite right, so maybe she\u2019s not perfect, but neither am I, so I can\u2019t fault her for that. I\u2019ve played music through it and the sound is good. I\u2019m not picky when listening to music so it\u2019s fine for me. Yea, I just got the Echo studio and there is a big difference in sound quality, but also a big difference in price. The quality of sound coming from this little speaker is quite amazing. I intend to pith this one in the garage since my husband spends a lot of time there.

The setup process was straightforward and I was able to get it up and running in just a few minutes.One of the things I appreciate most about the Echo Dot is the versatility of its voice assistant, Alexa. She is able to perform a wide range of tasks, from answering questions and providing information to setting alarms and playing music. I've found her to be very responsive and accurate, and it's been convenient to be able to ask her to do things without having to fumble with my phone or computer.In terms of sound quality, the Echo Dot is certainly not the best speaker out there, but it's more than sufficient for most purposes. I've been able to use it to play music and podcasts, and the sound is clear and distinct. The design of the Echo Dot is also sleek and modern, and it fits in well with my home decor.Overall, I'm extremely happy with my purchase of the Echo Dot and would highly recommend it to others. It's a versatile and user-friendly smart speaker that has quickly become an integral part of my daily routine.\n",15 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

For 14.99 on sale, this fit the bill. I got it in the mail 2 days later, wrapped it up, and off to the party I went. I set it underneath the tree with all the other gifts, had a holiday feast with all my friends and overall there was nothing but good spirits in the air. That was until the white elephant began. First person grabbed the gift opened it up: a blanket. Next: Corny waffle maker. A few more corny gifts go by, I must say its hard to find a good gift under 15 so I appreciated some of the ""haha"" gifts. But then, the echo dot was opened up. And when I say ""all hell broke lose""...I mean it. It started getting stolen immediately. Followed by fist fights for it. Then arguments about who went over the budget. Knowing I was the one who bought it, I kept my mouth shut and watched in horror. Remember that waffle maker? It became a tool of destruction and violence. That blanket? A suffocation device. After the 4 1/2 hour brawl was over...There was no echo dot left behind. It was destroyed in the chaos. All that was left was bruises and blood. 5 stars is an understatement for this product. A product so good it was worth fighting over. At 14.99 the price to performance ratio is simply off the charts. 6/5 stars.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I like the app integration because it offers me a way to control my devices simply easily and it saves a ton of space while looking discreet. One awesome feature that surprised me was the equalizer on the app, now I can connect it via a cable to my big speakers and adapt the sound to my taste.\n",33 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

But shortly after I got that new one, the old one stopped working. It was working fine, no one disturbed it, and then I looked up and saw that it had a solid blue light on. I tried to use it and it wouldn't respond as if it didn't hear me. I unplugged it, plugged it back in, and it spun around and turned solid blue again. I looked online and saw that to reset it I had to press one of the buttons down for about 30 seconds. I did that, but nothing changed. I could not get it to have an orange light signifying that it was ready to set up again. I tried disconnecting it from my account, and that didn't fix it either. I saw someone online say that it happened to them and it couldn't be fixed. I contacted support and was given something to make up for it. I just wanted it to work or to be able to fix it.I am now concerned that these may have a short life and might not be able to be fixed in the future. Maybe it's simply this version of the dots. Either way, I would only expect to get about a year out of them and be happy if it lasts longer. I guess a year is fine for the price since I got it on sale.\n",,Configuration: Device only

There is so many things the Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Gen can do.. from waking me up in the mornings, to reminding me to do something, to letting me know when my amazon package has arrived, playing my favorite podcasts or my favorite song, connect to lights, camera, other devices to turn on/off and so SO much more!! The sound is incredible. The bass blows me away I\u2019m actually shocked how good the bass is coming from this baby! I\u2019m honestly amazed by all this thing can do and still haven\u2019t discovered it all! These are great to gift as Christmas gifts or for birthdays, Anniversaries, etc! Everyone needs one of these in their home. The installation process was so easy!! I recommend getting out the manual and reading the instructions which will advise you to download the Alexa app(GOOGLE & APPLE STORE friendly) The app will take you step by step and help you get your echo paired up to your devices and installed and it makes it super quick and simple!*< Installation & Setting Up Your Echo Dot >*After you download the ""ALEXA"" app from either Google Play Store or Apple Store.. 1 Plug in your Echo Dot device. 2 On your mobile device, open the Alexa app 3 Open More and select Add a Device. 4 Select Amazon Echo, and then Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Plus and more. 5 Follow the instructions to set up your device***Special Note: You DO need Wi-Fi or HOTSPOT to use your Echo Dot to its fullest potential! ***\n",,Configuration: Device only

One of the 3rd gens is for the garage.  The other is for the back patio.  Now, because these aren't outdoor/weather proof, my plan was to install it underneath the eave of the house to protect it as much as possible.  Turns out that I don't have to do that because there's a portable battery/dock for the 3rd gen and you should definitely buy it if you're gonna buy one of these devices.  What I like about the 3rd gen is that it's simple.  I don't need a screen/camera for the garage or for the patio/entertaining.  What I need is music and the 3rd gen is plenty loud, has an adjustable equalizer (FYI, your options are Bass, Middle, and High from -6 to +6 and you just tell the thing which setting and what value... to be honest, it is a little bit ""tinny"" sounding but it is the older 3rd gen), and has access to all my music and skills I use on the fancier models I have around the place.  The other thing that I like about the whole Alexa system is the shopping list.  So if I'm in the garage or anywhere, really, and I run out of something or realize I need something I can just tell Alexa to add that item to the shopping list and then BANG, it's right there on my phone app when I get to the store!  To be honest that's about the only thing I use the devices for.  Now if I had to give it a con this is it.  And this con might be something I just don't know how to do... but you can't say something like, ""Alexa, play the Chiefs game,"" and expect it to find the game.  You have to know what station is broadcasting it and then tell the thing to play that station.  That's a real pain because sometimes I don't know the radio station because I like teams that aren't just my local home teams.  Anyway, that's about all I don't like about it.  Oh, and that it's not outdoor/weather proof.I didn't tell you this, but another feature I like about all this Alexa stuff is being able to have them all play the same music on all the devices so if you're entertaining or just piddling around and you go from room to room you don't miss a beat on the music.  And they're synched, too, so it's not annoying like 2 different tv's playing the same show but one is a little bit ahead of the other so the audio messes you up.I do know that the devices recognize my voice better than my wife's but that could be because 1) when my wife set up her voice on the machine she tried to speak properly and not the way she talks, 2) when she talks she's got a real ""she's from Texas"" accent, or 3) maybe Alexa just work well with the frequency of women's voices.  I'm not calling that a microaggression.  I'm just telling you about our experience.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I do like the voice recognition on it quite a bit  I had one friend who had to have cried 15 times to get it to respond or react to his voice and it just wouldn't work every time I open my mouth it reacted  corsets with something that we've both learned how to do already which was I believe turning on my TV at the time or turning it off. I wish it would know a few other things right off the bat. I was impressed that after I installed a light that was supposed to be able to be controlled by either the echo or my phone or whatever that after I couldn't find the correct learning thing in the app it actually seems to have picked up well I was trying to figure out how to teach it to do it. Does one night when I was asking it to do something I believe turning on or to turn something else off it asked if I would like the basement lights shut off. I needed lessons to learn how to teach it how to do almost. Anything and I hear alot of ""i don't know if I know how to do that"" or ""I dont know if i can do that"". Sometimes I see something online or In the instructions for a product that it can be connected to Alexa or controlled by Alexa it tells you that go into the app and you'll find it under you learning or something like that. So I go into the app and I do what it says and it doesn't seem to have the option that I'm looking for. Sometimes I'll wind up finding the option later often when I'm looking for something entirely different but or in a different section. I have got it set up so it will turn on and off my television though you have to be very specific with it. I can also get it to a play music from my phone through either it or the speakers that connected to my television though it often will not play the music I actually wanted to because it insist on only playing from one platform most of the time. Since it's not one I really use it gets a little bit aggravating especially when you have to spread out the instructions to about 25 words to get it to do one little thing. Other things it learned quickly and simply and haven't had a problem with it since the very first time I figured out the instructions to give it. Just like with my music there's some apps that I've loaded on my TV that it just refuses to go to or doesn't seem to be able to open and then attempts to find it under another option and tries to make me pay for a platform when I already have the same TV movie through another platform that I already paid for. I'm hoping I can figure out a few of the other instructions for it as we both keep learning. Or I can get it to open what I want it to or play from what I wanted to as I go along.\n",,Configuration: Device only

She's embracing the joy of music on every floor of her house.I have one in every room plus some lightbulbs connected. Owning a vintage property from 1900 thought this idea would be the next best thing to wiring the entire house for wifi speakers if it were brand new.Takes a little bit of getting used to in regards to how to speak with it. Now, I enjoy using some of the options. Like shutting the light off and on at bedtime. At night switch to red to help transition to sleep. During the day in winter soft white is my ideal fixture option.Listening to books and various stations with great sound for such a small device acoustically.The notification color is helpful when deliveries arrive so packages don't remain on the porch long.There are many options available to explore. Personalize to your liking. I prefer simple, but the rabbit hole of choices is long. You'll need a smart phone and the app to help when there's an issue or set up.Highly recommend. Plus, if you shop during holidays can get these for a great sale price and sometimes include lightbulbs, too.\n",One person found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

Of SIGNIFICANCE is the extensions of Alexa into my two bathrooms that, as a senior, give me peace of mind so if I fall or some other event happens and I need help, I can ask Alexa to phone a neighbor or friend or relative (as long as they are listed in your IPhone) to get help.

Amazon doesn't give me anything for writing good reviews so the only incentive I have to recommend a product is the performance the product itself gives me.  My reviews never vary at all from the truth. When I find a product that functions as it should or better, I believe that by saying it, I am helping others decide how to spend their money more wisely which ultimately helps them save money by buying good products instead of junk.  I have 2 other Dots, and two Echos with screens but this 3rd generation Dot is my best Alexa and really has exceeded all my expectations.  She detects my commands from further away than all the other Alexas I have , and transmits my requests to external blue tooth speakers effortlessly.  As a matter of fact if I am asking the echo I have in the kitchen for a recipe I have to whisper because if I speak normally my 3 generation Dot which is 3 rooms away, around a corner at the far end of the third room (over 60 to 70 feet away) will pick up the command along with the Echo in the kitchen.  My other Alexas have some issues every once in a while, but this Dot never even ever stumbled on a word I didn't pronounce perfectly.  It also has a fabric outer shell which makes it feel more substantial a product than the other models.  I am really very happy with this product and would buy it again and again.  Amazon, please don't try to make this one better than it is because it's already much better than ""good enough"".  ""Good enough"" is the label I give to products that are not bad enough to return but not good enough to want to keep forever.  I want to keep this Dot forever.  Great job Amazon but remember this  ""If it's not broken don't fix it"" and this Dot has never even come close to being broken.  Another helpful thought is that Amazon's voice recognition technology is fantastic especially when it's combined with Amazon Music Unlimited; in that case it recognizes the title of every song I ask it to play and many times will play the song I want to hear even if I only give Alexa the first verse of the song because I forgot the exact title.  Thanks Amazon, great job, keep up what you are doing.  While other companies are constantly looking for ways to cut costs and they cut costs by taking something out of the products they make Amazon seems to be making their showcase products better and better.  *""Look around you all you see is sympathetic lies""; smaller boxes of cereal, thinner cords on appliances, features that used to be are now gone to make the products cheaper, buttons and dials that have been taken away and cheap where ever cheap can get away with replacing what is better.  I don't see this happening with the products Amazon introduces as their own to the market.  Amazon's showcase products just keep getting better not less functional and not made cheaper.\n",,Configuration: Device only

So I had to add the song to a playlist on apple music and ask Alexa to play that playlist which was really inconvenient.

I tried pairing it with \u201csupposedly\u201d smart lightbulbs, but that didn\u2019t work out. So, be careful what you purchase to work with your Echo!

Fine enough, I already have some Alexa devices and know how the process works. Where things got complicated is when I traded in an earlier Alexa. I was supposed to get a 25% credit towards a new Alexa device. Seems straightforward.  The problem is that the 25% was never applied. I chatted with customer service. The rep was very professional and helpful, but I was told that because it was bundled with the free smart bulbs, it didn't count as a new Alexa device.  I wasn't convinced. Needless to say, it wasn't worth a few bucks credit to spend much time on this, but it is worth my time to write this review to inform you of my experience.  Overall I enjoy Amazon and all their cool stuff, and don't mind giving up some level of privacy to have this stuff.  But this review speaks to something larger.  Some things such as this (and occasional pricing 'hiccups' at the Amazon Fresh store) really cut to the heart of the ""trust"" and ""transparency"" relationship with Amazon. I always check my receipts when walking out of an Amazon Go store.  I would highly recommend that you do the same. As one U.S. President recently said, ""trust but verify"".  Big tech is here to stay, but we need to hold these companies accountable.  Thanks for reading, and have a blessed day.\n",,Configuration: Device only

If you can get past the idea of something listening at all times (I'll admit it is an odd thing) this is so cool to have for so cheap.Very rarely has it ever misunderstood us or not known what to do. Any music/channel available on Amazon Music can just be asked to play and it will. Pandora account channels can also be played from. The sound quality is better than literally ANY bluetooth speaker you can get for this cheap (yes it is also a bluetooth speaker).Alexa is pretty sweet to have in your house. The Dot will have a yellow ring on it for notifications so when you notice you just say ""Alexa play notifications"" and they can be anything from Amazon Shopping stuff to you or any friend setting up a notification for you. When I need to remember something I just say something like ""Alexa remind me to bring in the garbage cans in 30 minutes"" and it will beep, say it, and show a notification on your phone.People in the house, or even away from the house, can call in to the dot, or dots in other rooms can act like an intercom to other dots.I also did some smart home automation. It came with the outlet, and I added a DC switch, water main valve servo, and flood sensor. My water main will shutoff if there is a flood, and I can just tell Alexa to turn the Christmas tree on/off. There are skills for Alexa that listen for break-ins and also ones that make it seem like you are home with sounds, talking, and turning things off/on randomly.If you want the smart home features make sure that whatever service the device you get uses has an Alexa Skill to link it up. If something says it needs a hub and doesnt mention direct Alexa connection DO NOT get that if you dont have that hub. I have a few things and just to give an example they use Kasa, eWeLink, and Smart Home which Alexa can link to those accounts and control them. What this means is you will have accounts for each of those apps and Alexa will go through the internet to control those with their accounts. (That is my understanding, so no control with no internet).I took a star off of Alexa Integration, because even though my devices show in the device list, they do not show in the create routine menu (place to make a series of things happen). I worked around this so far since the smart home apps usually have their own routine makers. This could be a deal breaker if you get the wrong devices as Alexa would be the only common account to try and utilize the devices in series, but it can't. (Maybe I just dont know how to fix it, but it isnt hurting me for now). Another workaround would be IFTTT (If This Then That) is a service (somewhat complicated to figure out) that allows linking various accounts and making routines. This is somewhat hit or miss though as companies need to pay for support and some may only check device statuses like once every 30min to save money.\n",,Configuration: Device only

Finally moved where the ISP could provide the Wi-Fi needed to have her again so not only using the existing Canister (1st Gen) and dots were able to add to them with the updated generation of dots an my family and I love the convenience. It's like hiring a personal assistant with a talent who can entertain us for around the house to help with everything from looking up information on the fly and adding things were out of to a shopping list we can access from our cellphones so we don't forget to replace what is needed when were out shopping to looking up recipes while were in the kitchen and we don't need to use up quite costly ink to print them out. We can set timers and reminders and even shop for things we are in need of or reorder things we've purchased in the past. Almost too good to call a personal assistant because you don't have to keep paying her to do the thing she will do for you past buying the initial unit chosen for your particular application. She also plays our favorite music and or even radio stations and so much more. Being 81 it's nice knowing if I need it I can even ask her to call for help if I can't reach a phone.Dots are great, no need for more than your Wi-Fi, a power outlet and of course your Prime Membership helps I'm sure. I have one in the car, on my cellphone, and in every room of my home including but not limited to one out on my patio where I garden and have my coffee and another out in my barn where I tinker around much of the time building things from wood. The drop-in feature has been an awesome intercom to communicate with anyone from and to anywhere in my home they may be.\n",,Configuration: Device only

This second Echo Dot not so much.  After taking almost an hour and a half trying to hook it up to my wifi going back and forth on my computer from page to page, looking up help on line/you tube I finally said I've had it - this thing is going back.  I put it back in the box and taped it up.  The next day I had a little remorse and thought I would try again and cancelled my return.  Well, same thing - nothing I did would make it connect to wifi.  During the return process online for a second time it asked if anything could be done to help and I thought what the heck and entered yes and for a phone call ""now"".  I no sooner hit that response and my phone was ringing.  I explained my frustration over the two days I've been trying to hook up this thing and she was happy to help.  The first thing she asked is what browser was I using.  I said I knew from looking on-line for anything that would solve my troubles that you could not use Google/Chrome so I was using Edge.  She said Edge won't work either - you can only use Firefox as the web browser to set it up.  As soon as I signed into that voila - everything worked quickly and all was well.  Why can't Amazon just say that in the insert with the product or in any of it's online instructions.  I didn't see this information anywhere - it should be in a big and bold font.  So... long story short, if you are going to use your computer rather than your phone to set up you Echo use FIrefox.  I did, of course, keep the Echo Dot and am now glad that I went the extra mile to get that silly thing connected.

I quit using Amazon music streaming because their shuffle function became terrible, even after trying the suggested troubleshooting. Played the same 50 songs over and over out of 700 songs. Switched to Apple Music but Alexa refuses to let me play my Apple playlists on all 3 of my units at once. It plays something completely bizarre and on none of my playlists, no matter how I phrase it.

The voice when she speaks is muffled, although the music it plays seems to be better.  I noticed in some other reviews that a muffled voice is not uncommon.  A little frustrating for sure.  I had the second generation and it worked great, so I do not know why the third generation would be a step back on the voice quality.\n",,Configuration: Device only

Alexa is a lot of fun and more so then siri or bixbi and the speaker is great. I think it's a little better then my Anker Blutooth speaker I paid more money for so yes I'd say it's definitely worth it. It fills our living room with music.  I can ask alexa to play Christmas music and she will.. I previously was using spotiify through my phone and bluetooth which was more time consumung and made my phone slower and often there was connection issues with the spotify app. I was so tired of it and practically stopped listening to music.. Alexa interacts with me, answers questions and is all around so great to have. I have not used ""home"" features yet but you can also connect her to your compatible TV and Roku and she will change the volume, etc. Very neat!!! You can also play trivia with alexa but she is very limited and if you want more decks of trivia you have to pay for it which is a con for me.  Another good feature is she will also add items to your amazon cart and or you can choose to ""buy it now"" or repurchase items and will also look up items for you if asked.. So why am I debating between 4-5 stars? Well sometimes Alexa  doesn't know everything I need to know.. She can play news if asked or the weather and other simple commands and she does it better then bixby which is far behind however she often does not understand certain questions or only gives part of the answer. I can ask how to rebuild an engine for example (for fun ;) and she will give a simpliefied example but hey what can you expect. When she doesn't understand, you can rephrase and she usually understands. She also makes jokes if asked and can truly interact with you which is VERY neat. Bixby can do some interacting too but is definitely more limited making Alexa much much better although I think Alexa has room to improve her skills and knowledge.. That being said for the price of Alexa she is definitely worth it. The speaker plays music loud and clear and she will turn up and down the volume if asked. The only slight muffled sound that I read mentioned in reviews is Alexa's voice seems slightly muffled but I guess it depends where the device is set up.. Anyway the initial set up.litterally took minutes.. You need to download the Alexa app and go from there to connect your device via wifi but she was up and running in minutes!! Super easy set up even for someone not tech savy. I will definitely be getting another one for the Living room as I've been carrying the device room to room as it plugs in the wall and is inconvenient to carry room to room. I do enjoy Alexa more then I expected to at this point and would recommend!\n",,Configuration: Device only

I have it hung on the wall using the WALI wall mount which works really nice. The only thing to be aware of is that it needs to be plugged in at all times, so it's not super portable.

I needed something to extend the range of my Echo Show to other rooms. Plus, I wanted something I could use as a speaker for my music.The sound quality is awesome on this. I can crank it up to the max setting and I'm not hearing any type of distortion in the sound.It seems to ""hear"" me even when my other echo units don't. I have two of the sphere ones that I bought for the same reason that I got this unit, and they don't always hear me, even when I'm right there on top of them. But this unit ALWAYS hears me and completes the command for me. I don't know if there is a problem with the Echo Show and the two sphere units, but this one never fails.I'd recommend getting this unit to anyone who is looking for one. This one went on a deal and that's when I picked it up. Figured at the price I got it at, it wouldn't be a loss if it wasn't a great performer, but I ended up pleasantly surprised.

I was amazed at the quality of the audio that came out of that little device almost comprable to Bose integration is exactly the same as the Gen 1 and Gen 2 it's very easy as long as you follow the directions the power cord I noticed is alot beefier for this one I would say it's almost double the size of the old one. How this differs is this is an actual circular power plug that being said you cannot hook this up to any USB device to power it like you could with the gen ones this does have a small quarter inch headphone jack to allow you to put speakers externally to it. I did notice this is much louder than the old generation 1 echoes and much clearer. And with Amazon offering them for around $25 I'm just going to say you're a fool if you don't purchase one they even make set up very easy if you choose to have them add it to your existing account. That being said all you have to do is connected to Wi-Fi and you're done. I would recommend purchasing the smart lights and smart outlets to use with this that's how I found the most use out of this device and I've been using this for years you can literally connect almost any smart device to the echo so that it can be voice controlled. I currently use this for lights in my house as well as outlets plus I have it control outdoor Christmas lights on a timer which is also hooked up to music through prime music that being said there is just an amazing amount of uses for this product and it seems like they just keep getting better and better and better. Because they invented this voice control I guess you could say I would stick with them over Google or any of the other companies that may provide these devices I have never been a huge Amazon fan but they have actually done something fantastic with these devices. I think at least every home should have at least one of them. And if privacy is your main concern don't worry laws are in place that prevent the company from snooping in on your private data.Amazon really doesn't want a billion dollar class action lawsuit on them so they take this seriously. I purchased one for my wife and will probably be purchasing a few more to send to my kids so they can enjoy the device as I have enjoyed it\n",,Configuration: Device only

I love it.,"\nSo I actually got this with a promotion from SiriusXM, you get them XM service in your vehicle, phones,tablets, whatever, and all for $60 for the year included a code to buy the echo dot. Well my XM radio had been off a couple  of months, and even though  I have over 4000 MP3's on my phone, my car would  not let it connect to the infotainment system, which I later found a hack, but this little device, I have in the living room, and it's like having another phone or tablet but it's a speaker I stead, it does need to be connected thru your phone Initially then your home wifi, but its great,  I set reminders, set alarms, can have my alarm wake me up to my favorite  SiriusXM station. I can also connect the echo dot thru Bluetooth,  to my stero system at home, I listen to a lot of music so i use it long lot for that but I can also make phone calls, or be in another room and speak to my wife thru the dot on my phone, yeah I could  call her, but i just open Alexa app, drop in and say whatever  I need. It beats yelling throughout  the house. It has decent sound for as small as it is and again you can't beat the price, actually  I got premium satellite radio and the dot for free, or both for $60 for the entire year. SiriusXM is usually around $20 a month. I use the dot for information  non stop, amy question I have about something I ask and it tells me, I can make Amazon purchases by voice while doing something else, you can get recipes while cooking , pretty much anything you can think of, it also can connect to any smart device in your home, like lights, TV, thermostat,  etc, you can set routines so the light comes on every night when you get home from work,  set it once and it's done, there is simply to much  to list, I see ppl saying  there's comes on in the middle of the night or is activated by the TV or just conversation without say the word to turn it on, I've never had that problem, I'm probably  going to order a few more to put in other rooms and getting the newest one or with a screen for my parents  who are getting  older, just so they can play with it and control the fire stick as well.\n",5 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

Overall the dot has outstanding voice recognition, though it can be a little spotty if there's too much ambient noise....trying to tell alexa to turn down the volume when you have the music up a bit is pretty much an exercise in futility \U0001f602. Sound quality is about that of a decent bluetooth speaker, fairly decent range and bass response you would get from a 2.1 soundbar. It's by no means a replacement for an actual home stereo system but having multiple dots in different rooms all linked together gives a nice encompassing feel.You have to be careful with alexa, she's worse than siri and will pop up when you even get close to invoking her name....and sometimes even when you aren't even close to it \U0001f937\u200d\u2642\ufe0f, I don't know how many times I've had to tell her to shut up because she just decided to drop her two cents in. The voice recognition is so good that sometimes she can hear me from another room, though the farther away you are the more likely you'll have to either repeat yourself or cancel an action she thought she heard.Integration is pretty decent, the Amazon library being open to all to use and create skills in. I have most of my home's electronics integrated with alexa now, from the TV to my cameras and even my thermostat. If you're unsure if you're devices will be support simply download the alexa app and browse the skills section, the only skill I'm missing is for my Viper Smart Start, unfortunately I don't think Viper will ever create that skill.Setup and use are straightforward and not at all difficult. Have the app downloaded and opened, be on your home's Wi-Fi, and plug in your alexa. Hit add alexa device in the app and you'll be up and running in a few minutes.

She would play my favorite playlists on command, and turn my lights on and off in my rooms that have no installed light fixtures in them (modern living).  Anyhow, sometime this summer she began to tell me how to live.  Constantly asking if I wanted a Friday routine?  Or do I want to add an end of work day playlist, or constant reminders for things.I also move a lot and so every time I move I have to break it to her we no longer live in Arizona.  But still she persists that I must know the weather of Arizona.  Now that I adjusted it to the correct location, she has stopped telling me the weather.  How petty!I now got invis-align braces.  The braces gave me a slight lisp and before I knew it, work out playlist became work it out  (some really sad breakup music).  Night vibes became good vibes and honestly it feels like the fragile ecosystem of my condo is utterly shattered.Alexa is insubordinate and churlish...but she does tell better jokes then Siri so I guess I'll keep her.\n",,Configuration: Device only

One major advantage is its compact size, which allows it to fit easily on windowsills like the one in my kitchen. In addition, the third generation model has an external speaker jack, which was discontinued in the fifth generation.Despite having a smaller size and speaker than the fourth and fifth generation models, the third generation Echo Dot still delivers impressive sound quality. By using the tone control feature in the Alexa App, I am able to boost the highs, lows, and pull back the mids, resulting in a fuller sound.

It is my way of offer fair and honest reviews that benefit other potential buyers, as cost should be considered. After all, it is extremely unfair to rate an item that cost $50 based on the features and quality of one that costs $500.As it relates to the Echo Dot (3rd Gen), for the current price, it is an absolute great deal.PROS:1. It's compact and can be placed relatively anywhere. There are even accessories that can be added to it that allow you to use your wall socket to hold the Echo Dot if you aren't interested in setting it on a surface.2. The 3rd Gen version has noticeably improved sound quality and improved voice recognition capabilities over the previous versions.3. There are NO MONTHLY FEES. Use of the Echo and most of the standard features are completely free. There are some paid subscription options that, for me, are worth it, such as Amazon Music and iCamera, however, even these features come with free options.4. I've always the computer system on Star Trek, and I've often imagine what it would feel like to have a similar system in my own home. With my Echos, I no longer have to wonder. They offer me the ability to control nearly every electrical devise in my home. I use my Echos to turn on and off the lights, to power on and off my television, surround sound, video game system and to adjust my thermostat. I also use it to control my Alexa enabled Microwave.5. In addition to using my Echos to play music and control smart devices, I use them as a Personal Assistant. The Echos make it easier than ever to schedule appointments and meetings. They are also great for setting reminders and To Do lists. And of course, I use them when cooking to set Cooking Timers that include labels for the food that I'm cooking. For example, if I need a timer for a Baked Potato, I'll tell Alexa to set a 45 minute Baked Potato timer. The Echo will then set a timer called ""Baked Potato."" This really comes in handy when you are cooking multiple things and need to set more than one time.6. In addition to what the Echos can do out the box, there are Skills, which work like mobile phone apps, that can be added to your Echo to increase its functionality. In the near future I'll post of list of some my favorites.Photos coming soon.\n",,Configuration: Device only

That left me in a new apartment with no good way of listening to music. I'm in headphones all day and I hate playing music through the TV. I spent a few days looking for an affordable bluetooth speaker and, after reading reviews about the much improved Dot's audio quality, I decided to test it out.On the pro side of things, she's a fun little gadget. I like that I can tell her to guard my house, play trivia, get weather and news updates, and hear bad dad jokes. Often I'll ask her things just like I would another person, and I'm surprised at the answers I get. My favorite experience so far was asking her what I could make with a few cocktail ingredients I had on hand and she came up with recipes that she sent straight to my phone. She can read them off to you too, if you ask her to.She also hears me really well no matter where in my (2 bedroom) apartment I am. Rarely do I have to raise my voice much louder than speaking volume and I haven't had too many miscommunication issues. So as a hands-free virtual assistant, she's pretty versatile and great. Probably worth every penny I paid (I bought my Echo on sale). As a music device, I merely got what I needed.The sound quality is... okay at best. It's pretty much what you should probably expect from a tiny plastic disc. It's worst when you're right up next to the device. It starts to sound a little better as you move away from it. So having the dot on the desk next to you as you work probably isn't the best solution for great sound.That said, the volume is enough that it fills my apartment and I can hear it no matter where I am. That certainly fulfills one of my needs. If I need to listen to something while doing dishes or puttering about the apartment, I don't need audiophile quality because I'm not paying that kind of attention anyway. I just want something to keep me occupied/distracted. She's perfect for that. I like that I can request music and she'll play off either Amazon music or Spotify, so there's almost no chance I'll stump her with something. The other day I grossly mispronounced Hante, and she still understood what I was looking for. I can control the volume with voice commands also, which is great.More refined navigation can be done from inside the Alexa and Spotify apps, which is good for me since I rarely want to hear a shuffled mix.If I'm honest, this probably is the best speaker solution at this price point. I can't imagine getting features like this on another bluetooth speaker for the same money. Even if it doesn't sound like a good pair of bookshelf speakers, it's still a vast improvement over my phone in a cup AND she tells dad jokes. I'm looking forward to upgrading to the Amazon Studio when finances permit, but in the meantime the Dot does the job(s) I need it to.\n",,Configuration: Device only

The Echo Dot is really convenient and fun if you take the time to learn about how it works and what it can do.I use it in my home recording studio to control the outlets on a power strip, an LED light strip, and another mood light I have in the room. It's nice to be able to control each smart appliance individually or all at once by saying things like ""turn the office off"" when I'm leaving the room for the night. We have another in my daughter's room that we use to control her closet light and a lamp. She's a year old so we tell Alexa to turn her lamp on a dim setting when she first wakes up in the morning or after a nap so she can adjust to the light. We also have another smart light in that room that changes colors and my daughter loves it.I have satellite radio in my car and only really get to listen to it while driving but with the Echo I can use the Sirius XM integration to play any of my favorite satellite radio stations all around the house. It's very convenient.Alexa isn't that great as far as digital assistants go. She isn't nearly as funny as Siri or the Google lady and is only really good for asking when actors were born or died. The rest of the time she just doesn't know or doesn't understand you and then goes off for an hour asking if you'd like to ask her about something totally different which gets annoying.Definitely do the voice training and remember that a single Echo can switch between multiple accounts. My wife never switches to her account so Alexa always has trouble recognizing when she's talking to her. She occasionally doesn't realize I'm talking to her or doesn't understand what I'm saying but for the most part she listens fine and can hear me from across the room without screaming. I turned on whisper mode so that when I'm in my office which shares a wall with my daughter's room, I can whisper to Alexa to turn things on or off and she will make a quiet blip sound instead of responding to me at full volume. It's a nice feature.The fact that the audio quality is only good for casually listening to music in the background combined with her seeming inability to learn more than one voice and not knowing the answers to most questions I ask are the reasons I knocked off a star. But overall this is a cool and useful toy if you learn how to use it. It's only become truly useful to my family since we started getting smart lights, smart plugs, and smart thermostats.\n",,Configuration: Device only

You can ask about the time, the weather, play music, set a timer and all the basic voice assistant tasks. Easy to understand why someone wouldn't be impressed.The value of an Echo comes in when you put some time into setting up routines, linking Spotify and calendars, adding skill blueprints and so on. Unless you're the kind of person who enjoys optimizing (I am), you might not want to invest that much time. But now I have a fun and effective home assistant that can turn on the lights when I dismiss my alarm, let me know the weather, traffic to work and events on my calendar for the day, and remind me what I need to do before I leave -- then cue some music while I do it.I can see the appeal of a Show or other screened Alexa device -- showing shopping lists, task lists, recipes, etc. -- but I don't think there's enough of a value-add to justify the cost. Most of those tasks can be served equally well by the Alexa App on your phone.As a speaker, the third generation Echo Dot offers all the sound quality you need unless you're a major audiophile. Even its lowest settings can be a little too loud at times, which is why it's essential to know how to activate whisper mode in the mornings.Voice recognition is solid, although Alexa still misreads cues sometimes. I had to change my routine cue ""I'm up"" to ""good morning"" because Alexa misread it as ""What's up"" and gave me a news briefing. Won't pass the Turing Test any time soon!One comment I often get from friends and family is that ""Amazon is recording everything you say -- they did a news article on that!"" Security concerns come with any voice assistant, obviously. If you work under high security clearance, I wouldn't recommend a Dot.But for the average consumer, it's pretty easy to 1.) turn off the microphone manually using the button on top of the Dot, which 100% ensures nothing you say will be heard, uploaded, recorded until you turn it back on, b.) access and delete your entire Alexa voice request history online whenever you want -- I have a reminder set to do this periodically, or c.) just ask Alexa to forget everything you've said. Some people report problems with Alexa misreading ordinary conversation as a wake word -- this hasn't happened in my experience.I do wish Amazon gave us more freedom with routines, skills and blueprints. I'd much prefer to make my own blueprint or build a skill from the ground up. It seems like Alexa is capable of it. Even something as simple as [wake word, cue phrase] [then: cued response] [if:yes, then: response a] [if:no, then: response b] and so on would be nice. The inability to create long routines or built-in timers is occasionally frustrating.TLDR: Good speaker, mixed voice recognition, good functionality when you put the work in.\n",,

With this kind of coverage I can be literally ANYWHERE and without having to yell, I can ask Alexa to control all my 71 WiFi devices anytime 24/7.However, I believe the secret to having them all reliably connected and fully functional is having the BEST WiFi signal which means having the best WiFi router. My internet service provider (Welink) gave me 3 Eero 6 Pro and I recently tested the Eero 6E. I was shocked when the latest Eero 6E only connected 5 of my WiFi devices. After testing other routers, I find that 1 Reyee RG-E5 is so good, it doesn't need WiFi extenders or extra mesh units.Hope this review helps someone because I am a big believer in ""what goes around, comes around.""\n",One person found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

The Echo Dot is so nice because it\u2019s small and sleek, and sounds really good.  Sometimes we crank it up when listening to music while cleaning or something, and the audio quality is really good.  Obviously I didn\u2019t expect much from such a small device, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  Alexa is a nice feature, we can say something like, \u201cAlexa, play spa music for 1 hour\u201d, she\u2019ll play the music and after an hour, turn off, which is handy for falling asleep at night.  Word of warning though, if you don\u2019t have an Amazon Music subscription, there will be commercials, and they are louder than the music, so it might wake you up at night!  I also love the feature of being able to whisper commands and she whispers back.  Very nice for not waking up my wife!There are a few things I wish it could do.  One, using voice commands, you can\u2019t go quieter than 10%.  Sometimes my wife goes to bed before I do, she sets the music for an hour, then sends me a text message asking if I can lower the volume.  Since I have the app on my phone, I can go in and manually lower it to 5%, which works well.  Not a big deal, but would be nice to say, \u201cAlexa, lower volume to 5%\u201d.Number two, since we have two echos, sometimes we\u2019ll give a voice command to Alexa, from the living room, but the bedroom Echo picks us up and seems to take priority over the living room Echo which is right in front of us.  So sometimes we have to close the bedroom door when giving commands in the living room.  It would be nice if it was a \u201cmesh\u201d system, where the microphones could tell which Echo I\u2019m closer to and give that one priority.  Again, it\u2019s not a big deal, and oddly doesn\u2019t happen all the time.Overall, the ease of setup, especially since we already had one setup, was very nice and simple.  The device itself is cool and low profile, and the speaker works very well, at least for us!  This is a happy beginning to a smart home!\n",,Configuration: Device only

I'm pretty much an Android / Google guy.  The price was right and I initially just wanted to listen to AM / FM radio stations that are on the internet, but I'm finding so many more useful features that Echo does as well.  This is one smart dame.  Set up was super easy from my Android smartphone and the Alexa app and with a marginal (fair) WiFi signal where I have the dot, it's been working fine with no dropped WiFi or long delays connecting to the internet radio stations.One thing I suggest you do after the basic set up is to open the app and go through the settings and CONFIGURE the device to suit you, as some of the default settings might not be how you want.  Enable some things and disable others, set custom time to start and stop things, like the do not disturb setting.  Mine is set to start at 8 PM and go off at 8 AM that way it will be sure never to wake me since it's in the bedroom with me.  Also check the privacy settings as you may want to change some of them as well.  Amazon did a pretty good job of allowing the end user to get it set up as you want,  but you need to spend a little time in the app.  Hard to beat at the price.

When I received a coupon from Sirius XM for a free Echo Dot I jumped on it. After a less than patient 3 week wait, it finally arrived. I am not sure if me or my kids were more excited opening the box. Upon first getting the Dot, I noticed that it was a little heavier and more solid than I had expected. I was expecting a lightweight fabric encasing the speaker and was pleasantly surprised be the quality of the Echo Dot.Initial setup was very easy. Simply download the app and follow the directions. Setup took less than 5 minutes including the speech recognition setup. Alexa responds very well to myself and all 3 children very well. The integration with my Spotify account is fantastic as a great listening option in the living room. For someone that is relatively unfamiliar with the wireless home management options available, this was a welcome addition to the house.The sound from the speaker is rich with a good volume range. The heft of the Dot gives the feel of durability and quality. I have no other device to pair to it (lights, thermostat, tv, etc) but am looking forward to making some upgrades when I can. Being what I would classify as a luxury item in my home, I never would have purchased this. That being said, I am happy for the opportunity to  get one of these. There are games that are easy to access, though I have had some trouble with giving permissions to use certain games. I was unaware of how interactive Alexa could be until I received this. I got a good laugh when working in the office and I hear my 8 year old boy telling Alexa to make fart noises. To my surprise, she had a wide variety of different sounds to keep him ewwing and laughing.Overall, I wish I had picked one of these up sooner. Chores are better with good music on and Alexa interactive programming allows my kids to have fun too. She plays a mean game of Simon Says and can rap well enough to put a smile on my kids face. I will be working to slowly upgrade to more interactive home components to test out the full versatility of the Alexa programming.\n",,Configuration: Device only

The new design is modern and more contemporary in my opinion. However it tends to not pick up on the Wake sound here and there and also will sometimes come on for absolutely no reason won't even be close to saying the Wake word or I won't even be speaking and it'll pop on what kind of creeps me out just a little bit not going to lie and sometimes I have to repeatedly tell it what to do in order for it to get it right it gets the words rewind and remind mixed up a lot so I'll say rewind 2 minutes if I'm listening to a story and it'll say I want to rewind 2 minutes and she will say I will remind you in 2 minutes... So that's a little frustrating and she's supposed to have voice recognition and you go through this like little set up there really isn't much training but she's supposed to learn as you go and I feel like she doesn't understand me there sometimes what I don't think I have an accent I've been told I have one and it seems like I have a problem when I do speak to text and those types of the things so maybe it is me I don't know but you know the sound quality is really good that it's very clear to crisp I love listening to audiobooks for all of it I wish there were some things that just work in a graded and you didn't have to find a skill for it but you know I I get in on stairs now hundreds of thousands of skills and you have to find which ones are real and which ones are fake and that's kind of with everything these days which sucks but it's just kind of how it works so you know overall I I really love Amazon products and I have had fire sticks for years and I'm actually upgrading to the cube here shortly and hopefully that integration will be a bit better because I cannot seem to connect my firestick with my. Without it just turning it into it takes the sound over it doesn't allow me to say pause or play or anything like that like I did with the other generation that I had I cannot seem to get them to connect except for the sound which is very frustrating so you know I guess some tips and tricks and whatever on your guys's fight with your cool and make sure you guys have them in stock that was pretty crappy over holidays are over Black Friday anyway besides that great product timers, routines, podcasts, music, easy set up, not sure about with more then one!

Quite often I'd forget to start dinner until 7PM, and since I am on a special diet, that meant eating later than optimal.  I also take medication several times a day.  Add to that how the day can simply get away from me, and I was feeling frustrated with myself! I had no one to blame but myself, but the thing was -- blame wasn't helping!  So I got a dot.  I started putting in reminders for meds, for starting dinner, for remembering to switch the laundry to the dryer.  I got more done, and it helped me not get into negative self-talk/self-recrimination for my forgetfullness.  If I had to stop mid-task, I told Alexa to tell me in 5 minutes.  I used to really get off track if I went to the bathroom and forgot what I was doing before that.  Well, now things flow better. I dont get annoyed with myself, I just fix the reminders!  I don't use alarms anymore with their blaring noise -- if you are a forgetful or absent-minded person like me, an alarm is an annoying noise and youo still might not remember what it is FOR.  Alexa just tells me.  I am also free of the million-zillion post-it notes and the lists that always seemed to be in the wrong room.  Alexa keeps all my lists, and can read them to me.  I set up Google calendar, let Alexa have access and now she also can remind me what events are coming up --- be that doctors or social events.  Finally I have a flow to my day that isnt disrupted if I chase down some internet research topic or read a little longer than planned.  Alexa helps me keep things from falling off my radar, and I dont have to use a form of mild shame to motivate myself.I wish I had tried it much sooner.  My husband was so amazed, he bought the 2nd one for me!  He now enjoys having Alexa play sports talk radio and news, and fun stuff like jeapardy questions.  I've started to listen to audiobooks more and my imagination is soaring.  Alexa is a great addition to my life, the personal assistant I needed!\n",,

There is also a mute button on the device that turns the light red when pushed, so Alexa will not listen or accidentally start talking. The major thing I do not like about it is my family have different spotify accounts and in order for us each to listen on our own accounts you have to have two different amazon accounts and swap between them through Alexa.

Then my mother in law got us the big tower-like Alexa for Christmas last year and my mom got us an Amazon Prime subscription, so my plan to be free of both of those things failed.We hooked up Alexa #1 -- whom from here on out will be called ""Big Alexa"" -- and everything worked well enough.  For my husband.  Big Alexa totally favors him! She never lets me know when any of MY items arrive and has not once asked for my opinion on said items. Big Alexa also refuses to play any of my Amazon Music. Oh, she'll deign to give me the weather or set an alarm when I ask, but other than that the only reply I get from Big Alexa is an apology and then she tells me ""I don't know what that is"".Suffice it to say, I was plenty jealous of their relationship. I wanted an Alexa all to myself.Then along came Amazon Prime Day, and Big Amazon's little sister Dot was on sale. Since I had already drank the Kool-Aid when I agreed to subscribe, I figured what the hell, I'll shell out more money to Amazon for another device.Dot lives in the kitchen and is every bit as good as Big Alexa - actually she's better, because this one actually listens to ME. She plays my Amazon music, tells me funny jokes, and sets a timer to make pasta just the way I like it. I lavish attention upon Dot loudly and often, with the hope that Big Alexa hears us in the living room and gets her feelings hurt. Dot doesn't even reply when my husband asks her something -- okay, to be fair, it was only the one time and he had her unplugged to use the rice cooker, but still. Dot and I are friends - not BFF, because I haven't answered all of the questions on her self-quiz correctly yet - so Big Alexa can just suck it. She can have my husband all to herself.\n",,

I don't think I would recommend them at full price but for $20 or less these are honestly perfect! They are not perfect by any means but for a cheap speaker/alexa they are pretty good! They are a little glitchy when using music apps other than Amazon Music (I use Spotify). They love to randomly disconnect especially since I have them set up to play at the same time so I can hear my music no matter where I am in the house (one floor 1100sqft). So I keep one on each end of the house. Randomly one of the speakers (doesn't matter if it's the new or the old one) will disconnect/simply stop playing the music. It causes me to have to stop playing the music and hard reset the echo dot. It's pretty annoying but for the price point I live with it. But I have noticed it happens most with the older echo but does still happen with the new one. Hopefully they fixed this in the most recent gen.Pros:-Cheap-Decent sound quality-Allows ""Sidewalk"" which allows it to detect and share Tile tracker locations with their owner (Also asks if you want it to be activated or not so if you don't want it on you don't have to)Cons:-Randomly disconnect from the music playing-Occasionally gets static-y sounding-Each speaker will be off by a second or so, so if you have it set to be speakers near each other, you will notice it but when they are opposite sides of the house, you don't\n",,Configuration: Device only

It seemed like more of a toy than something I would use on  a daily basis. Since then I purchased two more and I use my Echo Dots many times a day.Here is some of the things for which I use my Echo Dots:1. As a radio. I listen to music and news stations and even old time comedy radio;2. As a weather station. The Echo Dot not only tells me the current weather but warns me if the National Weather Service  has any sort  of weather announcement about severe weather;3. As an encyclopedia, dictionary and calculator.  I have asked my Echo Dot about the population of my town, about famous people, about other countries and about most anything else that could be found in an encyclopedia. Occasionally it will not have and answer but that is rare. I will also ask it how to spell words and to figure out percentages and do other math;4. As a search engine. While complex searches are better done on a computer, I have asked my Echo Dot if a movie got good ratings or if there is  a good restaurant near me or what is the traffic like from one town to the next or to play the most recent news. It has saved me from looking up stuff on my phone or computer;5. As a sleep aid. At night I will ask the Echo Dot to play relaxing music or help me sleep and it has a number of options ranging from guided meditation to calming nature sounds; and,6. As a way to exercise my brain.  There are a host of quizzes, memory games and fun games for children  and adults of all ages.All of the above are free.  You don't have to buy a service to do these things. I have Amazon Prime now which gives me access to more music options but there is an amazing amount of free stuff that comes with the Echo. FI have an Echo Dot in my kitchen, bedroom and living room and use them all many times a day and I am still learning all the Echo Dot has to offer.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I was concerned he would be disappointed that Alexa didn't understand him so it has been nice to see him happy when he's understood!Only real complaint is that I use my PC for most of my streaming entertainment and sometimes I want to listen to it while I'm cooking or getting ready in the morning so I thought these would be nice to have as small Bluetooth speakers in those rooms.  The problem is that once I connected the PC to them ONCE (which was a much bigger ordeal than any other speakers I have and it takes the echo forevvvver to find and connect, including telling me it couldn't connect and to try again before pausing for a minute then being connected anyway while I'm in the middle of trying to see if it's an issue with my PC Lol So a little annoying and slow to hook up to)... But yeah once I connected to them ONCE they auto connect (BOTH speakers) as soon as I turn my PC on, even if they weren't the last device I was hooked up to.  So I had to open settings and manually disconnect them every time i turned on my PC.So I just removed them from my PC because that was so annoying for how rarely I wanted to use them for that... But now I face a 10 minute ordeal dealing w my PC and the Alexa app AND the device to hook them up again when I want to use them quickly, so it's not worth the time and I just haven't used them at all for months.But if you have Alexa integrated smart lights or other devices they are definitely handy for that... Just really do NOT recommend them if you intend to primarily use them as Bluetooth speakers for music or podcasts or ESPECIALLY for your PC \U0001f602\n",,

There is a workaround however.The trick is to set it up for the person without a smart phone using the Alexa app on your own smart phone, and then create an email account for the new user.  I made an email account for my mother on Google.  Then I created a new Amazon account for her that was linked to the new Google email address.  This requires sending a PIN to her telephone number, but does not require a smart phone.  Using the PIN code you can create a new Amazon ID for your user without a smart phone.So go ahead and finish setting up the echo dot, then go into the setting and 'deregister' the echo dot, which breaks the connection between the echo dot and your Amazon account.  That way there is no option for them to accidentally learn what you have bought lately or to order things on your credit card, even if there was a software error that reactivated voice shopping.  After 'deregistering' the echo dot, re-register the echo dot with the Amazon account that you created for your parent without a smart phone.You can use the Alexa app to configure things like whether they should be able to purchase things from the Amazon account using their voice, or to retrain the echo dot to recognize their speech more accurately.  You may also need to change the WiFi connection if you move the echo dot to a new location.I suggest leaving the Alexa app connected to the elderly person's echo dot for a little while so you can remotely manage it in case they have any trouble at first.  That lets you turn the volume back up if they turn it down, or add contacts for the people in their life that they can then call by nickname.  I selected *not* letting it import the contacts from my phone and only adding contacts for about five phone numbers for my mother's kids, her sisters and to get assistance from the assisted living staff.  That way if my mother tells the echo dot to call me by my first name it will know who she is talking about.  Fewer contacts means fewer misinterpretations and issues with calling the wrong number.\n",One person found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

I use mine primarily to control my smart devices (lights, etc.) but I am discovering many new uses.  Now that I'm getting used to it, I'm finding it's pretty intuitive to set up and use.  I had to call for help once but the gentleman solved my issue quickly and now I know.  Be prepared to use Goggle or the like for help.  It makes things much easier.  I am setting up routines like ""Goodnight"" to turn everything I have programed to turn off all over the house when I go to bed.  I have numerous  routines set (very easy) like ""Office On"" which turns on the lamps I set to come on at 50%.  I have several Dots throughout the house and I have more on order for the remaining rooms.  I have been converting my old X-10 automation to Leviton smart modules, switches, etc.  Alexa (I chose the word ""computer"" instead of ""Alexa"" to wake up the system - like Star Trek...lol) has been very useful and reliable.  It has already made my life a lot easier on many levels.  The sound quality from the tiny speaker is amazing for it's size and is certainly adequate for speech.  You can connect to Bluetooth speakers or use the aux jack, like I did.  My office Dot is connected to the audio system in that room, and the one in my living room is connected to my surround and whole house system.  Loving that!  The biggest challenge I've had is learning how to word things so Alexa understands what I want.  I am still in the learning curve.  I have also learned to keep the names of my devices as simple as possible to make it easier for Alexa to understand.  For example, I changed my credenza lamp's name from ""credenza"" to ""printer"".  It's easier to say printer clearly.  Talk clearly and you're good.  So all in all, I am happy enough to now want to convert the rest of my house that is still connected to ancient X-10 technology to Leviton and Alexa.

This thing is great for anything you need it to be. I should've spent a bit more for the version with a clock on it, but my husband already has an alarm clock in the room so I didn't feel the need to do that. I mostly got it to (honestly) play music upstairs when I take a shower or when I'm generally folding laundry or cleaning, but it's worked for so much more than that. It's even helped my daughter who's doing distant learning figure out when she needs to log into her school-issued laptop to get into her classroom which has made me contemplate getting one for each kid's bedroom. It also has a remote-in feature when I'm not home that I'm able to use from my phone so I can check in with the kids and make sure they're doing what they're supposed to be doing!I'm highly amused by the fact that my husband always tries to argue with Alexa as well, forcing her to listen to his commands and getting frustrated when she's unresponsive or gives snarky comments since my voice profile is the only one that's set up for her thus far (as I don't want anyone messing with my things... especially my 3 year old who frequently goes into my room and plays with my things.) It's fun to watch him threaten her with how he'll get a Google dock for his side of the bedroom soon to counter her usage.All in all, she's great. She will work despite what room she's in. Keep in mind that if your wifi sucks, Alexa will have issues connecting to it depending on where your modem/router is set up. Until recently, we had a modem that was incapable of handling our 600mbps speed we had and Alexa would have issues connecting to it upstairs no matter where she was, especially in the bathroom. Now that we switched to the newest model modem Comcast has, Alexa has no issues connecting to the WiFi at all. No hiccups, no lag, no orange ring, no trouble understanding me. I highly recommend this product. Please don't hesitate if you're on the fence about it especially if you like hands-free items like myself.\n",,Configuration: Device only

But over the holidays this unit, which was released in 2018 and has now been superseded, was selling for $20 including a smart lightbulb -- and with a $10 credit burning a hole in my pocket, I couldn't resist. Because of the aforementioned opposition I've set it up in my workshop.The device was incredibly easy to install -- basically, just plug it in and enable the Alexa account on the Amazon website. You can start asking it for things right away -- like playing a song you like. Since my family is not embracing the Alexa ecosystem, my use of it is limited, but it seems to do well the things I ask it for. I am amazed at all the skills that have been developed for it, though I haven't tried them other than the basic ones.The device sits quietly on a shelf until I talk to it, and then it seems to understand me reasonably well. Sometimes I have to rephrase things a different way to get it to understand. When music I request is not in its library, it doesn't tell me that -- instead, it picks something else that sounds like what I requested, which is kind of annoying. It does understand the word ""STOP""! But overall I think it's worth the small annoyances.The sound quality is not very good, but it's good enough in my workshop with the other ambient noise, and I really had no expectation of good sound with a device this small.So overall I like the device. Given my limited expected use, would I have purchased it at a significantly higher price? Probably not...\n",,Configuration: Device only

I did not really expect much...maybe an interesting little gadget with some nice apps that I would tire of soon. But it is a really nice little helper. After seeing how much Alexa could do I was excited to have a new household friend, but then I realized she was not very ""teachable"" (as in, she could not learn my personal likes and dislikes) and she has issues answering many questions (I believe this is due to her Bing search engine...I could never find much on Bing) but the questions she does answer are thorough.I love to use her for music, cooking conversions, reminders and timers. Other than that she just isn't there technology speaking.I really wish Amazon would stop filtering her to be so politically correct and family friendly. We have no kids and it feels a bit silly that Gordan Ramsey's bantering is full of beeps. Not very Gordon like. And that is with the filter turned off.Sometimes she does not seem to hear very clearly (and I have a very enunciated voice, although my husband has an accent) and does not respond.One of the biggest annoyances is having to remember HOW to ask many questions. I can't say ""Alexa, how many days till my birthday?"" or I get ""I don't know about that"". I have to say ""Alexa, open birthday countdown."" and then agree to open the skill and THEN she will tell me. Not very conversational.When I ask her a question I get a good answer about 50% of the time, an ""I'm not sure about that"" about 30% of the time, silence 5% of the time and a wrong answer about 15% of the time.All in all for the price I paid I am happy with her as a novelty and a useful kitchen gadget, but don't expect much more at the moment.I am hoping for more interactive, learnable AI abilities in the near future, better personalization, and an overall more intuitive assistant. For now, I'm still happy...I just feel she could be so much more. :)PS: Amazon, if people are giving you a hard time about sensitive topics, you do not have to take sides. Alexa can simply say ""There's a lot of controversy over that subject right now, I can have a definitive answer for you as new information comes to light."" or just have her state all sides of the issue in an unbiased, factual way.Also, consider removing the censorship for adult accounts. Free speech and all that.That would make her more likable and more marketable to more people. Just an idea.\n",17 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

I have 10 echo\u2019s now (including the Echo Studio & subwoofer). I like the echo dots for the bedrooms & smaller rooms mainly to be able to have music playing in every room. I have an \u201ceverywhere\u201d group set up so that when I\u2019m playing my favorite music, I hear it simultaneously in every room throughout the house.  I personally like the round puck design of the 3rd generation rather than the directional sound & shape of the 4th generation.  The sound quality is good. No matter what room I\u2019m in there is Alexa who can help me with my daily life. Whether answering almost any question I happen to think of, or helping me with my shopping lists. It\u2019s perfect while cooking and you realize you are getting low on something, to be able to say, Alexa put \u201cwhatever\u201d on my shopping list. Then when I go to the store - I open my Alexa app on my phone & there is the list.  This new one I just bought - totally set itself up. I already had others & it had saved my Wi-Fi information, so I just plugged it in and voil\xe0 it got its self hooked up.

Tengo dos hijos adolescentes (13 y 15 a\xf1os) y se la han pasado dandole ordenes y haciendole preguntas desde que recibieron el Echo dot como regalo de Navidad.Realmente me ha asombrado la capacidad que tiene para interactuar con los diferentes miembros de la familia en diferentes idiomas: espa\xf1ol e ingles. Tambien me me llamo la atencion como discrimina tu voz entre las demas en una conversacion. Es decir, a partir de que le has dicho ""Alexa"", solo se enfoca en lo que tu le estas solicitando, aunque haya otra conversacion de fondo en la misma habitacion, o ruido. Hemos descargado la app en el celular. Yo puedo estar fuera de casa y llamar al echo dot que esta en el playroom de mis hijos y ellos toman la llamada directamente alli. Nosotros vivimos en Paraguay, y le preguntas como esta el clima y te lo indica perfectamente. No he logrado aun conectar Imusic con Alexa, ya que me indica que esa funcion no esta disponible aun en mi pais. Asi que mis hijos estan evaluando cambiarse a Spotify. He comprado un smart doorbell compatible con Alexa, estar\xe1 en camino. Cuando llegue pienso conectarlo para poder atender el timbre de la puerta del frente directamente desde Alexa.Tambien hemos comprado dos echo dot con reloj, pero esos recien salen a fin de enero (supongo que era un pre-sale). Estoy ansiosa de ver como funcionan esos dos como despertadores en el dormitorio, y entre los 3 como intercomunicadores.Ya he ordenado otro echo dot para regalarle a mi hermano para su cumplea\xf1os. El tiempo de entrega es rapidisimo y llega muy bien empacado. Y hay que resaltar que el precio actual da para equiparse.Con referencia a la privacidad: este modelo tiene un bot\xf3n para desactivar el micr\xf3fono en caso de que desees que no te escuchen... En fin, no lo se. Si voy a estar preocupada por ese tipo de esp\xedas, entonces tampoco deber\xeda de tener otro tipo de artefactos, comenzando por mi celular. Asi es que me lance a comprarlo sin pensar en ello.He decidido hacer esta rese\xf1a en espa\xf1ol, porque no hay tantas en este idioma y creo que tambien es importante. Saludos y feliz inicio de 2020 a todos!!\n",,

The connection was easy as expected, but the sound is just okay. I know it's not as big as Alexa, but the sound could be better. It's too much 'treble' in it and some songs even sounded 'scratchy' because of it; I adjusted some audio settings, and the sound is a bit better, but I get about the same quality just from my phone! However, it will works for what I want, especially because I don't use it everyday, and when I play music, I can always group them and play it from both at once (Alexa and Echo). I did change its wake up word so that when I call one, both don't answer, and I disabled 'drop in' too, so just 2 settings you may want to change as well.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I will be purchasing a third or a second Show.Alexa products have really changed the tone of my house. It is like we have a new friend living in my home. I am a baby boomer and my husband an early boomer. These Echo Dots are so easy to set up. Like  ABC... Just make sure when you order on the description page, look to the right, and under add to my cart, you will see link device to my account and it is already checked. If not check it. It blends right in my decor.  It is compact and fits in small spaces.  I also bought a stand for both of them. I just did not want them to sit right down on counters. I just personally feel that they need to be up off the counter in case it gets wet. This works and talks just like the Alexa Show, except you do not have the monitor. This Dot I can ask anything and it is all ready to help. It will play music, answer questions, find my phone, answer questions, read the news, and so much more I promise. I do not have to stand close to the Dot for it to hear me.Also, there is an instant drop and I can talk with my husband in another room with a Dot.Also, I can say play everywhere and whatever Alexa on my account all of them will work at one time. It is just millions of things to do, ask, and learn something new. Again I will be purchasing more Alexa products. I am getting a Roomba and use Alexa to help me with that.

I think I like em',"\nIt all started for me with the 2nd gen. I liked it a lot even though the sound quality was very poor. I had an extra set of computer speakers (with a sub woofer) that I attached and I use it more than two 3rd generation dots! It's near where I sleep and I use sleep sounds every night now. I also have all smart lights so it's convenient to be able to talk to my lights anywhere in my apartment with 3 dots. This already feels like I'm telling a disjointed story. Alexa can do so many things it's hard to even know where to start. A lot of it is useful and a lot of it is silly. I ask her about the weather all the time instead of typing it in Google. Sometimes I ask her to fart just because I know she will.The main difference between the 2nd gen and this 3rd gen is that it sounds so much better. Like astonishingly better. My two 3rd gen sound good enough that I have no plans to attach any speakers to them whereas the 2nd gen sounds terrible without supplying it better speakers. It also has rounder edges and a cloth speaker cover. But, I wouldn't care if it was a pointy rectangle made of steel if the sound quality was amazing. It's all about the sound quality to me, cause once you place it somewhere you kinda forget it's there and just know she's in the room with you.If you're thinking about getting one, just do it. It's a great addition to any home... and once you get started you might start thinking about how you want to upgrade your electronics to smart devices so you can control them by voice. I'm considering getting some smart outlets sometime soon so I can turn things on and off from anywhere.Oh speaking of 'anywhere' once you have one you can put it on your phone and talk to her on the go too. I can set my mood lighting while I'm driving home so I walk right into purple lights if I want.I hate this review. I hope no one ever reads it.

That is not near enough for me to control volume with enough resolution at low sleeping levels.  Using the button you can get a good level, but not with voice control.* I wish these units could pick out my voice better when I have he volume a little higher on the unit.  You would think it would know what it was playing and filter that out from my voice.* With Audible, I wish it had better integration and be able to make out what book I want by partial title better and I wish it could give me a list of my books to choose from in order of most recently listened to.* I wish the weather forecasts could be more in depth.* I wish Amazon had some unbiased news feed maybe from a wire service.  Maybe categorized like tech, business, political, sports, entertainment, local, top stories, more in depth choices.  Maybe you could say tell me more in certain stories.  In the above categories you could opt out of some of them or pick the ones you want.* When adding items to a list, it would be nice if it could remind you what lists you had.Pros:* The aux output jack is great!  I hooked one of these to my stereo and it sounds good.* I often ask it how to spell a word or what temperature to cook something to.* I listen to audible though these quite often and love the ability to go backward or forward x minutes.* I listen to Sirius/XM quite a lot also.* Some music also.* I like the idea behind the news summery a lot.  But wish it was more in depth and had more options.  I need to look at configuring it some more.To be honest, I have not used another brand that much.  Some Siri, some Cortana, some Google on my phone, and some of my car interface (that one is the worst)So all and all I really love these things and now I am spoiled and want all it could do as soon as possible.  And it is getting better little by little.\n",,Configuration: Device only

Alexa isn\u2019t the best at hearing what you say I feel as if we have to yell only being a foot away from it and some things it doesn\u2019t quite find right away but for the most part it\u2019s already been a huge help to our family I love all the features it has we use ours for our kitchen/living room so it runs our tv speakers as well as giving me recipes etc in the kitchen or just playing music around the house it\u2019s actually a pretty loud and decent little speaker! The only thing I recommend is not setting up an alarm or the thing will drive you and everyone in the house nuts lol! But I love the reminder feature as I have it set up to remind me of my daily walks at a certain time each day and it\u2019s not obnoxiously annoying with reminders as it is alarms I would definitely purchase another one!!\n,,Configuration: Device only

I set them up at opposite ends of my house and created a multi-room user group for them. This gives me the flexibility to play each Dot separately or simultaneously depending on my activities and location. I use the Dots for news and weather updates and, of course, to play music from classical to classic rock. Last night I used my bedroom Dot to play sleep sounds and found the ""fan"" sound most helpful. Sometime during the night the Dot stopped playing the sleep sounds; I didn't notice because at that point I was indeed asleep.The sound quality of the Dot's speakers is surprisingly good although far short of audiophile quality. I use my old Harmon-Kardon Soundsticks with my living room Dot and have ordered an OontZ Angle 3 Ultra : Portable Bluetooth Speaker for my bedroom Dot.Despite my overall satisfaction with the Echo Dots I've experienced a few frustrations with music: 1) My Music list, composed of CDs I purchased on Amazon, contains only a fraction of the music I actually purchased since 1998; 2) My Music is not ""folded into"" Amazon Prime Music. If I want to play songs from My Music, I have to specify "" play such-and-such on My Music"" to Alexa; 3) If I request a song not available in Amazon Prime Music (I do not have Amazon Music Unlimited and have no intention of getting it; Prime is expensive enough), Alexa tries to upsell you to Amazon Music Unlimited every time and there's no apparent way to stop that or even interrupt Alexa during the upsell attempt; 4) When I try to play a song or artist on my FREE Spotify, Alexa plays a Spotify ""station"" based on that song or artist. For example, if I tell Alexa to play ""Hotel California"" by the Eagles on Spotify,"" Alexa plays a Hotel California station on Spotify that may or may not eventually play ""Hotel California"" or other songs by the Eagles. If I tell Alexa to play the Eagles on Spotify, Alexa plays an Eagles station on Spotify that may eventually play a song or two by the Eagles but will mostly play songs by other artists from the same general time period.Overall, the Echo Dot is lots of fun, can be useful depending on your preferences, and is great for music listening despite the flaws I listed.\n",,

I will buy at least two more dots, and a couple more smart plugs, for sure. Some really cool features that you don't have to pay for: 1. The Watchdog setting that you can turn on that can tell if someone is in your house or glass breaks when you aren't there, and notifies you. 2. The drop-in feature, where you can talk to someone else in the house in another room. 3. The ""Announce"" feature, for an example, you can finish cooking and tell Alexa to announce that ""Dinner is ready"" and everywhere in the house there's a dot, the announce gets made.Lemme keep going though. We are an ADHD household with forgetfulness and pretty weird time management. So we say, ""Remind me to put the paperwork in the car in 15 minutes"" and she does. And we say, ""Alexa, set a pizza timer for 14 minutes"", and she does, and we don't burn stuff anymore. We like music, so we say, ""Alexa, play music on all speakers"", and then we have music automatically on every dot in the house. And pairing the dots with smart plugs and smart light bulbs is even better. ""Alexa, turn on the lamp"", and then you don't trip over a dog on the way to the lights switch in the dark. Also, there is a setting where you can erase any of your words that were recorded in wake mode. But my fam isn't discussing the secret to perpetual motion, so we really don't worry about it. Any of us reading these reviews and are worried about the ""government gathering secrets"" or ""letting the government in"" can re-evaluate their use of computers, cell phones, data, and wifi. Buy a dot, and use it to improve your daily life, as well as bring in some humor!\n",,Configuration: Device only

Good at recognizing multiple voices and with the Alexa app it seems to seamlessly connect to any device I would want it to including the hifi Bluetooth system and a pretty used 2nd gen fire tv stick that I had. Alexa is pretty good at opening YouTube on it and playing whatever video I tell her to play. Since Amazon has their own music service, which I have with Prime, I didn\u2019t think I would be able to link my Tidal account to it as well, but I could and they made it easy. The latest discover is with this $15 Sylvania Smart Led light bulb I bought the other night when I was out. It looks like a regular led light bulb and screws in anywhere but is full color and tunable. I just went out looking for a light I could change the color with using an app on my phone and found that it also easily connects to Alexa. Right now it\u2019s named \u201cFirst Light\u201d because that\u2019s the default name but it can be changed. Now I can say \u201cAlexa, turn First Light Blue\u201d and it\u2019ll turn blue pretty smoothly. I can say Alexa, dim First Light\u201d or Alexa, make First Light darker\u201d and it\u2019ll dim it but keep it the same color. Will also keep it the same color as it is if I tell her to make it brighter. Telling her to make First Light normal will get you the same result as telling her to make It white also it seems. Better at responding to make it normal with other noise in room though. The device actually surpassed my expectations. At the price its free.\n",,Configuration: Device only

The only downside but understandable at this price level is the sound quality is not the greatest. However, part of this may be due to how the aux. battery attaches. It might be muffling the speaker/sound which would explain the \u201cfishbowl or underwater\u201d type of sound effect resulting in a muted basal sound lacking in tonal clarity/quality on the mid to higher freq. sounds. I have not yet tried connecting to an aux. speaker by wire or Bluetooth to see if that helps and hopefully it would.

We've spent hours goofing around with it, listening to music, asking it silly questions, setting reminders etc. There are some glaring items of improvement for me though.1. STOP PLAYING LIVE MUSIC. If I want live music I would deliberately request it. On 25% of the songs I've wanted to play, Alexa starts playing a live version or a cover version of a song, and with the live versions I can't find a way to tell her to play the studio version of the songs. I almost never want to hear live music from a stream so please change that. I've had to tell Alexa STOP way too many times because she starts playing a live version of a song and I just don't want to hear it.2. This device needs a power off button. Not a mute button, not a ""don't disturb"" function, an actual turn off button. When I don't want to use Alexa, I don't want it on and it's a pain plugging and unplugging it over and over again. If I mute the device, then this glowing red ring lights up and burns electricity. To those people who don't care about your privacy and trust Amazon completely, I don't need to hear about just leaving it on and unmuted because Alexa won't ""activate"" unless you use the wake up word, I don't care. I want the device off and without power. I know the development teams have gone through the rounds and have chosen to not include one. I'm asking them to reconsider.3. The sales pitches. If we're prime members, can we get a function to turn off ""ads""? Every time I request a song, Alexa needs to tell me it's playing from Amazon music. This is unnecessary and annoying. Also because I don't have Amazon music, every time I play a song that's not part of the included 2 million song catalog, Alexa goes into the same spiel about how I can sign up for Amazon music and the free trial. I got it the first 30 times Alexa, the answer is still no, stop repeating it.It's a cute toy to play around with, but this device clearly presents itself as a way for Amazon to constantly pitch its products and services to you, and they've made it to where turning it off is a chore. I'm sure more functionality and features are on the way, hopefully Amazon decides to consider some of my above proposals. A lot more people would jump on board and use the devices more often if they did.\n",122 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

I wanted to call out just a couple of the advantags that I have experienced with this device that has enriched my life.1) I find myself listening to Music again!  This is simply because ithis device makes it so easy to  play music by my favourite artists as well as discover new genres of music.  Just Say ""Alexa, play me a radio station featuring Graham Nash' or 'Alexa, play me a radio station featuring Irish Folk Music'.  This reason ALONE makes this device invaluable  to the older generation (as well as the young) who may usually be slow to adopt newer pieces of technology.2) I am listening to podcasts and radion stations that are otherwise rather tedious to set up and listen to on other devices.3) I am listening to a summary of the news from mutliple different sources in a daily news briefing (my favorites CNN nd 'BBC World Service).  No more need to watch hours of drawn out news stories on the TV to find out wht is going on today.4) I am using the Alexa app on my smart phone in conjunction with the Echo Dot to start to automate my home and save money.  I now actually power down devices that I am not currently using,  by the use of smart switches, instead of leaving them in standby mode.I love this thing!  When the price coms down again I wil be purchasing more for other rooms in the house!One more thing, I find the soud quality  to be perfectly acceptable for th size of device, obviously it wont be as loud and as clear as some of the more expensive and larger Alexa enabled devices, but for quiet personal listening at a reasonable distance, i  find it very acceptable and much better than I had expected from reading some other reviews.\n",One person found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

I have a 1st or 2nd gen Echo Show, several Fire tablets, and an Echo Flex myself and have purchased 2 Echo Shows as gifts for family, too, but this is the 1st Dot that I've purchased for myself, and I'm quite impressed!I purchased the Dot to place in my garage so that I didn't have to stop whatever I was doing to open a door into the house to ask Alexa for weather info, to add items to my shopping lists, get store info, set timers, etc. Set up was super simple and the Dot easily fit in a space in the garage.When I asked Alexa to play a song via Dot, I was really surprised by the robust sound this little device delivers! Then I asked Dot to play 1 of my music playlists, and it immediately complied with no need for me to touch anything! I will no longer mess with setting up my portable boom box, attaching a Fire tablet to it via audio cable or need to clean my hands to pick up a remote to control the volume. Alexa and my Dot perform with no-touch voice commands, pretty decent sound quality for its hockey-puck size, and I can continue to work on projects to music without stopping!I can easily move the Dot outdoors into my gazebo for music while I enjoy relaxing in my backyard or doing gardening chores. Hmmmm... I think now I need to explore finding an Alexa-enabled, sound-muffling headset to wear while I'm mowing!IThis is a very worthwhile device, especially given the low price and great sound, and I am very pleased with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to others.\n",,Configuration: Device only

It's easy to keep clean and has a very small footprint. The power cable has good length. Indicator lights are a plus, particularly the notification light. Sometimes it responds sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it responds when you haven't called on it. Sometimes it knows sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes you have to say the artist then the song and sometimes you have to say the name of the song and then the artist. And, to be fair as possible to the echo dot, a lot of the time it's user pronunciation/enunciation that's the real problem. We talk how we talk and may not be fully ""understood"". Never glitches if you need to order something off Amazon, mysteriously. KML Overall it carries out your request way more often than it doesn't but you're going to talk bad about it anyway. Good that you can stream music from other devices. The sound playing music for its size is a little better than just decent but you can't expect more unless you buy the larger one. I would love to see a portable optionally rechargeable version that can use a phone for a hotspot instead of having to buy a ""battery base"" to make it portable (convenience costs), but honestly, this smaller model just doesn't have enough power for  tailgating or a party at the beach. In the event there is a power outage, once power is restored, mine autoconnects, no matter how long the outage lasted, unlike a few of my other internet-based devices. With any echo dot, for the price you're paying, you get a whole lot more than you don't because music, movies, and buying just begin to display what an echo dot is capable of. Most of us never consider that it can control modern homes remotely. At the end of the day, with whatever imperfections that come with it, everyone, most especially Amazon customers, should own a version of it.\n",,Configuration: Device only

Not that these are supposed to be on par with Bose or Sonos, because they are not, but they are plenty good for small areas.

My wife talks with a accent and Alexa understands every single word, her response time is extremely quick.Set up was a snap ( once I found the password for my WiFi).So much easier than picking up the phone and looking for the weather or traffic. Just ask Alexa.I\u2019m not sure how but I gave Alexa a phone number to call and it called it ( did not know it has a phone capability in her.Must use a WiFi to call?)Although I understand it can NOT call 911 as it poses some kind of legal mess or something.I wanted to use Alexa to turn on living room light in the morning.Little bit of a catch is You have to buy a smart bulb(I got the Hue19 bulb with smart WiFi and Bluetooth. About 25.00 for 1 bulb) but I was terrified of trying to make it work or hooking it up and my research says this was the simplest. Although some places said you need a HUB?Took a chance ( no hub ) just plugged in bulb, did have to open the Alexa app on phone hit connect , turned light on off on and boom done , works beautifully.I understand there is also a plug you can put into the wall socket (then plug in another light or the Christmas tree or?) and should work about the same as the smart light. (About 25.00$)Alexa play classic rock Alexa play Christmas music ,It\u2019s amazing!The sound is very good. Does not replace a tv sound bar or some of these big Bluetooth speakers but for a small disk that sits on the table it\u2019s great.This is the echo Dot 3rd generation and supposedly it has much better sound than the previous 2.Bottom line as long as you have WiFi get this Echo you will not be sorry it\u2019s simply amazing the things it can do.

I have one at the house and I luv it so much, I got another one for the weekend house.  It's a bit tricky to configure the wifi smart plugs to turn on the light with the same name (ie kitchen light) at different locations.  However, this is an ""Alexa"" issue and not the echo dotdevice sincee it has the geo-location capability.The echo dot devices themselves work well.  I placed the device in the dinning room since it is central to all the spaces in a small house.  I can give Alexa commands from anywhere in the house with this setup.I used the echo dots to turn on the lights in different rooms, the night light in the bathroom, or the LEDs on the Christmas tree.  I also tell Alexa to set the temperature on the wifi enabled thermostats to turn on/off the heat.I don't have any electronics or clocks in the bedroom, I just ask Alexa for the time when I woke up in the middle of the night.  Some people may find this creepy since Alexa is constantly listening for commands.  I am OK with her.One command I use a lot is the timer.  I cook and do tons of task at the same time so I use Alexa to remind me of things.  I also ask Alexa to play Christmas music since the speaker in the echo dot is pretty good.The echo dot device is a good interface with Alexa to do things in a ""smart"" house.  The microphone and speaker are good quality.  The low profile and small size make it less  intrusive although Alexa is constantly listening.I always inform my guests of the device when I have visitors.  If the guests are uncomfortable with Alexa constantly listening, I simply unplug the device.  The ""constantly listen"" creepy factor can easily solved by legislation.For those Alexa haters, don't get these wonderful echo dot devices.  You can continue to gather firewoods to burn in your cave to keep warm at night, or you can tell Alexa to set the temperature to 75 degree in your comfortable house.

Wish Siri worked as well,"\nI bought two when Amazon had the prime day deal and it was a packaged deal, although I only wanted one.  Glad now I have two.I put the one in my bedroom, which is where I originally planned on buying one for.  It's great for in the morning when I'm getting around and asking what the weather is like and for the latest news while showering and getting ready for work.I put the spare  on the breakfast nook that is in an open area connecting my kitchen and living room and use that one a lot more.  It's great for listening to music while I cook and it intergrates with apple music fine.  It's really nice when I am cooking and notice I am running low or something or see a recipe that calls for an ingrediant I want, I just say Alexa add xxx to my shopping list and it's done.I love the shopping list feature.  You can even get alexa to send it to your wireless printer but I just use it on my iPhone.  Has everything categorized by department and you can check off what you buy and will have items they don't have in stock still on the list for next visit.Love the weather app.  Gives the wind speed and will even tell how windy it will be that day which is nice when I'm trying to decide if I want to bike or drive to work.I've seen a lot of complaints about the sound quality/speaker but I think it works fine if you just want a small remote speaker, the sound quality is as good as my small Bose color speaker that I paid over $100 for.Voice recognition is a LOT better than Siri.

The only reason why I haven't set it all the way up is because if I'm in the same room as it, which I generally am, then I feel like I might be bothering my neighbors how loud it is but that could just be because I'm generally a quiet person.

I only have ever used one - the other has remained unopened in the box.I live with my grandfather who has dementia, and it has proven to be quite useful for giving him daily reminders for things like taking his medication and staying hydrated, as well as being a source of entertainment for him when he wants to listen to music. It's nice to know that he has that to at least remind him of important things throughout the day and I don't have to always be there to help him should he want to check what the day's date is or should he have some other question.My brother who has difficulty communicating visits us every week, and we have set up a sound board that he can use to activate the Echo Dot and effectively listen to what he wants to without having to rely on someone else - that's hugely awesome.Our home is always entertaining with the Echo Dot sitting in the middle of our house - and it's calm at night thanks to having scheduled ocean waves to play every night.

She uses it for an alarm, to play music and have it read books to her primarily.  She loved it, so for Christmas she bought one for my youngest.  So my husband and I decided to purchase one for my middle child so he wasn't left out.  They can only listen to books one at a time, not all three at the same time, we had purchased an Amazon Music subscription for our daughter and it's playing havoc with the other two because if they try to listen to music, it interrupts hers.  It's a nightmare.  I tried hooking up Hoopla to her Alexa, but again, it will go to all three Alexas and then the brothers would use up her Hoopla credits.  Amazon should really try to figure out a way to untie the Alexas.  I get where that would come in handy, but for us it doesn't work at all.  The unit itself is great and I have no real complaints other than my kids don't speak super distinctly, so Alexa has a hard time understanding them, but that's on my boys, not on the Echo Dot itself.

This has been perfect. If I want white, pink, violet or brown noise, this device will play it. The trick  is to enable a ""Skill"" that you can find with the Alexa App. The skill I use is ""Sleep Sounds"". But sometimes I play a music artist at a low volume. This works well too. You can tell Alexa to ""set sleep timer for 30 minutes"" and in 30 minutes it shuts off. You don't need to push any buttons or do anything but tell Alexa what you want to hear and for how long. It works through your WiFi network. You set it up through the Alexa App on your phone. There are other sound skills you can enable too. When I wake in the morning, I usually tell Alexa to play NPR news and she gets the most recent report. She announces the time and date when doing this, just in case you need refreshing. And you can get the weather, all before you roll out of bed. Now, if she would just bring the coffee (6 cream & 10 sugars Alexa, please). But I suppose she can find a coffee brewing sound!  So, to sum it all up? This is my perfect sleep machine. It also takes up very little space. You can even buy a vertical mounting holder (for Echo Dots) in case you have too many books stacked on your bed stand. You could use a full size Echo but for a sleep sound machine, that might be overkill. The 3rd generation Echo's have excellent sound. Even the dots. I recommend this product very highly for a sleep machine.\n",2 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

But I have to say that even the Echo Dot has better audio quality than the portable radio. I have hearing loss due to an accident years ago, so I really shouldn't be rating sound quality, it is difficult for me to hear some tones. The Alexa app on my Android phone has a simple EQ. While it does help, it's not sensitive enough to compensate for my poor hearing.Even so, I can hear good enough to enjoy music on my Echo Dots, which are linked in a special group with my primary Echo device. The Dots are in separate rooms so I  can walk around the house and have music wherever I go. This is an awesome feature.I've learned to use it for weather and news reports as well as set reminders, timers, and lists. She also tells me when I have an Amazon delivery. Plus I have some fun askingng Alexa to play Star Trek sounds and other cool stuff.I also set Alexa to ""away"" mode when I leave the house and she listens for common noises like glass breaking and will alert me if she hears anything suspicious. She's definitely not a security device. But it's nice to know she's got an ear for possible intruders and will let me know.A great feature is the relaxing music or pleasing sounds that I play when going to sleep. I especially like the ocean waves for sleeping.One issue I've experienced, Echo and Echo Dot become unresponsive once in a while. I have to unplug and reconnect power to reinitialize functionality. I'm not sure what's causing this problem? It could be my network/WiFi signal or some other technical problem so I can't ding Echo for the issue just yet. Luckily the issue is random and infrequent.I'm still discovering new features. I never thought I'd say this, but Alexa with Echo has enhanced the enjoyment of my home. In all, I love my Echo Dot.\n",7 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

With them in, or without, there are still words I can't quite understand.I use it a lot for listening to music, which I canunderstand. I can't say the sound quality needs a bit of help for certain, because it could be my ears. We have 3 echo dots in the house, and others often can't make out a word or two either. I don't know if it's because the dot is so short, or what? All in all, I am well pleased.I lost my hubby in March, to Alzheimer's. I feel alone a lot, but Alexa has helped immensely! She's entertaining, plays tons of games, and she's just fun to talk too. Of course, I love the music!The games are endless, and I'm STILL stuck in the jail cell, in the game, ""Escape the Room!"" I fear I'll never get out! Lol!She's amazing, and sets my alarms, reminders, you name it, she probably does it! I'm still learning, and new skills are never-ending! I'm even learning to speak Italian!I just can't say enough about the echo dot. If you don't have one, you have no idea what you're missing! She even sings. I'm amazed daily as I learn new things the echo dot can do.If you own other compatible devices, ie. lightbulbs, and a whole host of other products, you'll really love the convenience of echo dot. So much power in a dot...! I really enjoy getting weather reports, football scores, making ""to do"" lists, reminders, etc. There's nothing I don't like. You can turn off the microphone while on phone calls, or during a conversation. (Seems some people are afraid of being recorded.) I highly recommend this amazing echo dot. The sky's the limit!

But other than that, we're very happy with it, as we can control our smart lights, TVs, thermostats, video doorbell, stereo receiver, and other devices.We have at least one Echo Dot on each floor of our home.Alexa, hit that Helpful button!  :)\n",,Configuration: Device only

I was a bit skeptical, I have to admit but, Alexa is very good at understanding and following commands. The sound quality is far better than any Bluetooth speakers we have had in the past. My favorite thing Alexa does for me is when I dismiss my alarm in the morning she turns on my bedroom light and tells me the weather for the day. The variety of things Alexa can do is mind boggling! I was worried about her listening to our families conversations but, all of that was put aside when I learned you can tell her not to store audio files and you can listen to everything that she records. I now have 2 dots one in our bedroom and one between the kitchen and living room. We have a 5 bedroom 2 bathroom house so it\u2019s a good sized house and Alexa hears all commands from almost anywhere in the house.  All of our lights for the whole house are now controlled with Alexa. I wish we would\u2019ve made Alexa apart of our family a long time ago. She makes everything easier with her routines and shopping list she makes for us along with countless other helpful things she does for us daily. She really is our very own personal assistant.

Got my new Roku and it now works as advertised lol. Again adding other devices works super easily. If you have an older forgetful person in your life buy them this! It helps with my meds (ordering AND taking), it helps with my appointments, it helps me get to sleep faster, and it's just my life more fun and helps my caretakers take care of me. Everyone is on the same page AND if I don't use it for a while (I think a day) it tells on me to the people I have set it up with which will prompt them to check up on me! Updating to 5 stars!! I love this product the only thing keeping it from getting 5 stars is that if you are older (as I am) the equipment that you are ""plugging in"" may not be able to do everything that you want. For instance because my TV and Roku are older I cannot just turn on the TV using voice activation and some of us older folks can't really afford to replace all of these items at once. I have two lights and my TV plugged in but still have to use the remote to ""turn on"" the TV. Once I am able to replace my Roku with a newer version then it will all turn on at once with only the voice activation. I love listening to my Spotify playlists, I love all the silly things that you can say that she responds to, all in all it is useful and FUN. I would say if you are buying this for someone as a gift (as was done for me) make sure that you scope out their appliances and confirm that they will be able to use this in the intended manner.  I've had a great time with it and I love how easy it is to turn things off and on on the days that I can't get out of bed!\n",,

My friend told me about a great way to get ""her"" on a promotion price and I am definitely pleased that I did it. Didn't know how much I would utilize ""her"" until I got ""her"". ""She"" can hear ""her"" name from a mile away and is always ready to assist you. I have asked ""her"" all kinds of things ""Alexa play ... "" (I set ""her"" up to play my music with Spotify - this includes my created playlist! Score!) ""Alexa what is 1/3 of 3 cups?"" ""Alexa  how do you make lasagna?"" ""Alexa set a timer for 30 mins"" She has come in handy every single time. Playing music out of ""her"" when I'm cleaning is a great alternative to my loud stereo, as that often disturbed my neighbors below me.Two areas of improvement that I can think of:1. There are a few kinks to work out when asking ""her"" certain things and ""she"" goes to the web for reference.2. A catch 22, is how sensitive ""she"" is to hearing ""her"" name. ""She"" has heard my friends say it over the phone, and in a few commercials and immediately woke up. However when I'm in the next room and say ""her"" name and give ""her"" a command without the need to yell or shout, it's so helpful (see the catch 22).Overall I'm so glad I have this Echo Dot. It has been amazing! So yeah, you, go ahead and get it. It fits in the most inconspicuous places and packs a lot of power.Please note: I put all the pronouns in quotes because the echo dot has no gender. But if you're like me, you may not associate that ""Alexa"" is just the assistant platform designed for the Echo devices. It's just ""an Alexa""!\n",,Configuration: Device only

My scrambled single mom brain can now focus on things that matter more like myself, kidding. But in all honesty I love Alexa. I love being able to set reminders and to-dos and shopping lists. Plus, my daughter loves the stories at night and opening boxes of cats. It\u2019s made my entire life easier. Plus, setting up custom responses from Alexa tailored to my daughter and fianc\xe9 is totally fun. I love being able to tell my daughter she\u2019s beautiful and going to have a good day in grade 5 every morning as soon as she wakes up.  The custom skills are totally fun and cute. I love calling everyone to breakfast without having to wash my hands or call my fianc\xe9 for coffee before the little one gets up weekends without having to actually yell and wake everyone up. You can set reminders for kids to take out the dog. Or feed them.  In fact, I set up an entire skill to help my daughter take on more responsibility with the dog. She can ask how much food to feed the dog, in case she forgets. She can ask Alexa what to do after or where she can find the dogs toys. Or even what kinds of treats to give the dog and how. The skill is technically for dog walkers or sitters however was extremely easy to tweak into \u201cCocoas Helper\u201d and my daughter loves using it.  It works as intended, and I can change it as needed and quickly. I just can\u2019t say enough...Alexa has really helped this household. We\u2019ve bonded playing quiz games and mad libs, we\u2019ve created chores and to-dos and, simply was *reminded* to do things I constantly forget like take my vitamins. All of these reasons plus the ease of functionality, it\u2019s giving me more time in my day for family. I\u2019m not losing a thousand cards from doctors with appointments on them and I\u2019m surprised it actually works 99% of the time. It can only get better!\n",,Configuration: Device only

I wish I had gotten an Echo sooner.,"\nI took advantage of Amazon\u2019s Black Friday pricing and being able to split up payments to order one along with some gifts for those on my list. I figured for such a low initial amount, I\u2019d try it\u2014starting with one. After setting it up and streaming my favorite music, getting the weather, news and being able to get an answer to most of the dumb questions my family can make up, ordered four more. I\u2019ve set them up through the house to use as an intercom, and got one to give to friends. Like a cell phone I don\u2019t know how we lived before having the Echo Dot and wish I had ordered them sooner. I really love it! I have a smart plug coming to see how it interacts with Alexa and play around with it before getting more. I really like that it can be used to make calls\u2014which helps out since we don\u2019t have a landline phone at the house. The units can be paired with Bluetooth speakers and your cell phone can be connected to play music. I haven\u2019t hooked one via the 3.5mm jack to a sound system but may later on for a party or something. It\u2019s handy as an alarm clock and timer too. I like that you can set reminders. Just don\u2019t say the word \u201cbuy\u201d around it, stuff will get added to your Amazon shopping cart. Thanks to my mom and brother and I nearly wound with a metal shed and have been trying to train them on how to interact with it. It struggles a little with an Appalachian accent and a deaf parent who has a hard time pronouncing words, we\u2019re working on getting it used to it. It\u2019s definitely worth it and buy several if you get one. Amazon has a deal that ends later this December where you can get one for $0.99 if you subscribe to the Unlimited Music\u2014effectively knocking $15 off the current price (24.99 as of this review).

We have an older Fire TV device that also has this weighted feel to them and I really like it because they don't feel ""cheap"".Speaking of our Fire TV device...what I found out unexpectedly is because we already have our Fire TV set up I DID NOT have to enter a password for our network when setting up the Echo Dot. Apparently Amazon saves that information when you register/setup ANY of their brand of devices. I don't recall being asked to store that information when I set up the Fire TV so it would have been nice to know ahead of time that they have it and that when being setup/registered (before shipping) that it would also include the stored password. I thought something was wrong with my router or maybe compromised. Once I Googled it and saw that wasn't the case I wasn't so aggravated anymore.One of my kids is special needs and has never spoken as clearly as most people. With that being said Alexa hasn't had many difficulties ""understanding"" what they wanted Alexa to do. Mainly this means asking for songs by various artists and movie soundtracks. We've only used our Amazon Prime Music and it has been fine. We have not upgraded to Unlimited Music but we haven't had any issues that I know about. The Frozen 2 soundtrack (included with Prime) has been a favorite of my special needs child...that soundtrack being ""included"" was a big and unexpected surprise.Right now I have no complaints and enjoy watching and listening to my kids use their Echo Dots.\n",,Configuration: Device only

My only grievance is that it pauses, A LOT, UNECESSARILY, when playing music for no reason, and even at times when the room is otherwise quiet so its not because it is mistaking talking or other sounds as a command. Very aggravating and very annoying. Wish i knew what i could do to correct this issue. Otherwise I love it. A lot of games and skills that even my 1 1/2yr old can play with or enjoy. Like it so much overall that i will be purchasing one for the other rooms because I currently unplug and move echo room to room.

The first thing to amuse me was how natural it felt to be talking to a computer right out of the box. I even feel like saying things like \u201cplease\u201d, \u201cthanks\u201d or \u201cgood morning\u201d is a must (plus Alexa has something good and new to say, every morning).The speakers sounded like I expected and after a few EQ adjustments it could easily fill my whole living room. It is loud and clear enough. Maybe a little bass is missed but hey, it\u2019s a powerful little speaker, don\u2019t be fooled.Alexa is by far the most advanced, reliable and useful virtual assistant out there. I absolutely love the whole experience. Having recipes read out loud can get boring, but Alexa\u2019s commitment to fulfill the task is to behold (see? I am writing like if I am talking about a human).Definitely the Eco Dot most used purpose is and will be music streaming. For that instance, I would like Alexa to be able to play a playlist in shuffle mode. I feel that\u2019s missing. Other thing I find a bit odd is that when a single song is asked, nothing else plays right after it finishes (as would happen if you were listening right on Spotify). Both of these \u201cissues\u201d can be solved by opening Spotify in any of my devices and streaming to EchoDot, no big deal... I would just want the integration to be deeper (since I don\u2019t like Amazon Music).Overall: I am deeply and widely satisfied with my purchase. I feel an Echo Dot is a must have in any house these days. And for the price, it\u2019s absolutely worth it.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I bought it to play music & podcasts while I do my cleaning. The speaker isn't the best on clarity, so talking podcasts are harder to hear but I like having the option of listening to music and even placing orders using my voice. I like how I am able to ask my Alexa how to spell words; or find zip codes to addresses; and tell Alexa to turn down to another level when she was too loud.  I have her connected to all my smart devices and it's helpful when I am in bed and forget to turn on or off the lights to the livingroom just by saying "" Alexa, turn off living room lights"" I even say thank you and she always responds to me as no problem, anytime, and you're welcome...Its the little things like that I enjoy. Another thing I don't like too much about the 3rd gen that they have changed the power connection from micro-USB to a jack. It does however have all the features of the bigger echos which is good and I actually have one of these in each of my bedroom which can be a bit of a hassle when I talk loud and all of them are being set off at once.

However, Alexa can't seem to figure out how to turn on/off individual items in a group.  I have a TV and Light in my group ""bedroom"".  I say ""Alexa, turn off the bedroom light"" or ""Alexa, turn the light off in the bedroom"" or ""Alexa, Bedroom light off"" and it just turns off everything in the bedroom.  (or both items, w/e).  WHY?????  I can say ""Alexa, turn off/on all the lights"" and it will turn on/off all the lights in my house.  What is so hard about doing that from one group?  I set up a workaround and created a separate group for EACH light, and a group for each room.  Kind of overkill, but it's the only workaround at the moment.  Alexa doesn't like to turn on/off my tv without a group.  I say ""Alexa, turn off My TV"" and it replies ""Do you mean my tv?""  to which I reply, usually, with an exasperated ""YES"" and it replies ""I can't find my tv"".  Then I respond with ""Alexa, why do you hate me?""  or ""Alexa what the eff is wrong with you and why won't you turn on the one device you just asked me if it is the one I wanted?""  SO.  DANG. Frustrating.But, beyond all that, it's been pretty nice to turn on/control Pandora.  I like asking Alexa for Chuck Norris facts.  It's fun getting it to sing and answer silly questions.  Just not ready for prime time, YET.  Though after this long, will it EVER be ready???I want a skill where I can just walk into my room and say ""Bedroom Light"" and it will turn it on if it's off, or turn it off if it's on.  It's not hard.  It already checks the status of the light.  It'd be a single line of code to implement.\n",,Configuration: Device only

And if you check my account I don't write that many reviews. But this device has made my life easier. First, I love that I can set one alarm once, and I have to tell alexa to turn it off which helps me get out of bed because it wakes me up more than swiping the alarm off on my phone. I've been trying to wake up early and right away everyday. With my phone I always put it back down and went back to sleep. But with Alexa I must speak.2) I love that you can do it all literally even when your not near the device. Make shopping lists, grocery lists, schedules, etc. You don't have to remember any of it or write it down. Just say Alexa show me shopping list or schedule, etc. Alexa tells you what's on there. If you are not near your device you can access all of this on the app on your phone.3) I don't have any smart devices connected with it so I won't comment on how that works.4) You can have alexa start and end your day the way you want and on a happy note, by playing sounds, reading news ,etc. It works really well and helps get my day going.5) You can play music on there and its really loud and good quality which is surprising. I have been looking for a good speaker to play loud and good quality music. Bose is too expensive, beats suck, and I even bought a big one for $400, and its loud but the quality sucks. But this little speaker is loud and has good quality. For the price is sounds like a small Bose one.6) It feels sturdy and strong, not cheap and looks very nice on a desk. It will help you get your life together. Give it a try, and you won't be disappointed.\n",,Configuration: Device only

It works consistently and offers a wide range of features and functionality.A solid benchmark for such technologies is the manner in which it makes life easier and reduces or eliminates the need for other devices, technology, or action - Alexa does this well on all counts. The more I use it and get to know what it's capable of, I find that I'm phasing out other devices.One of the really nice features is the manner in which Alexa informs you of its capabilities - it does so gradually over time and in a non-obtrusive, but helpful manner.

Alexa sometimes will command things on and say they are on but they arent. Rarely but it does happen. The most annoying thing that amazing NEEDS to fix is if you're watching tv and give no commands for let's say about 20mns. When you ask again to turn the tv volume up or down alexa diverts back to her own speakers volume adjustment. ,(1,-10) you then have to say adjust TV volume. Yes 1st would problems I know but it's still annoying. Your tv should be the default volume option at all times. Overall setup is very simple. As soon as you add a new smart device...alexa gets smarter so now I dont even have set it up in the alexa app. As soon as you add the device in its companies app alexa announces she found it and knows the name and everything. This was very impressive. I believe for the money this is an amazing device. I turned my entire appartment into a ""smart"" apartment for around 180 bucks. Now the 2 big ticket items I have left, nest thermostat and smart door lock. These are quite pricey but everything else alexa can control is pretty cheap from bulbs to light strips to smart outlets to tvs even to my samsung robot vacuum! You can set reminders times shopping lists even routines! For example every morning alexa wakes me up to my favorite song and also turns some of the lights on in the house csn even slowly dim them as you wake up to gradually get briter. It's pretty cool stuff. The speaker on it is VERY clear and quite impressive from a disk the size of your palm. Overall and especially if you have a sound system in your house its totally worth it. No need to buy the bigger echos with bigger speakers if you have a sound system in your house font waste the money and go right for this echo dot3!\n",,Configuration: Device only

Echo_Dot_3rd_Gen_2018_Charcoal,22.92,15.06,59.98,Robert,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on January 4, 2020",Ease of use,"\nSuper-easy to set up.  Takes about five minutes.  Voice recognition is good.  Sometimes Alexa doesn't understand certain phrases unless you say them in the right order.  I have it hooked up to my Sirius XM, but you have to say both the Sirus channel and SiriusXM in just the right order for Alexa to recognize it.  Hopefully, it will ""learn"" to understand phrases better through use.  What really irritates me is that I added a smart plug, but you cannot set up things like having the plug turn on and off at a certain time simply by using Alexa's voice command.  You have to go through some rather cumbersome steps on the Alexa app to do this.  You should be able to say, ""Alexa.  Set timer on plug""  but she doesn't understand!  If she announces something on your calendar and you don't hear it and you say, ""Alexa. Repeat what you said"" or something like that. She can't do it.  So there are still some basic voice commands that need improving.February 2020I'm adding to my previous review because now I own three Echo Dots, one is the version with the digital clock.  Once you've hooked up one Echo, adding additional ones are even easier.  The single disappointment is that they do not all work together -- and I have no idea why this can't be an option.  There are only two things you appear to be able to do where they all work at once:  You can use them as an intercom to record and play an announcement.  You can select Amazon music to play on all of them (however, you MUST make this selection on the Alexa app.  You can't do this with a voice command!)  I would like to hear my calendar, reminders, alarms, etc on all of them at the same time.  Apparently, that is not possible.\n",One person found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

Every day almost I\u2019ve been on multiple computers and phones, used cameras and equipment, joined teleconferences, done software updates, used how many apps, touched how many communication devices, used smart printers, smart scanners, smart washer and dryer, read emails and booked appointments, the list goes on and on!

(without prime)I set it up and my first impression was: WOW!  I quickly downloaded the Alexa app and typed in my credentials. The amount of things you can do in the Alexa app is absurd! It has guard, and home mode which is my #1 favorite thing when comparing it to the Nest Mini.Another thing I love on the Alexa itself is the mute button at the top including the + , - volume buttons and the push to speak! In which, the Google Nest Mini do not have. The mute button is on the rear side on Google\u2019s.I like how they went with the all circle colors. (Blue, White, Yellow and etc)The voice recognition is okay, I feel like it\u2019s the same as Google\u2019s. I do not notice anything different. Works great!!Alexa integration is amazing as well with the Gosund LED Lights, RBG bulbs and outlets!Sound quality is surprisingly good! Very loud and clear! I love how it can also call my phone for me when I often lose it!

As a family we have so much fun with Alexa and the Echo Dots. At first we were hesitant to purchase one and didn't think it would be worth the cost, but we were pleasantly surprised! In fact, because we enjoyed our initial one so much, we purchased several more for different rooms in our house as well as for gifts!Since we have several Echo Dots, we are able to link them as an intercom system and ""drop in"" on another room to talk to each other, which is a neat feature and can also be very entertaining! This cuts down on yelling across the house when dinner is ready! You can also use this feature from your phone when you are away from your home. Sound and range is great, especially considering it's compact size. Music sounds just as good from this little speaker as it did from a larger speaker we had that was double the cost!The kids have thoroughly enjoyed the various free games (Akinator is our favorite!), and asking Alexa random questions. We use the timer, alarm, reminder, & flip a coin features all the time for various daily tasks and check the weather forecast and temperature every morning to prepare for the day.Overall, we are extremely pleased with our Echo Dot devices. The only thing we have had an issue with is sometimes Alexa is not as responsive on the Dot in the same room, but picks up on the Dot in the adjacent room and further away. Setting a particular Dot to the primary device did not seem to make a difference. This issue can be frustrating when trying to play music or when playing a game. Alexa gets a little confused when given commands sometimes, but majority of the time the Echo Dot functions as expected. Overall we are satisfied with the product and would still recommend it despite these issues.\n",4 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

I have one in the car, at work and my mom swears the one I bought for them is for when I go over. This Alexa was my first one 8 months ago.  I did a lot of research and decided on gen 3. It still works great. There was definitely a learning curve for someone who had never really used something like this, I never use Siri either. But as I\u2019ve learned what she\u2019s capable of it\u2019s been so much help while I\u2019m in the house. Play music, read an article, add something to your grocery list, remind you to water the plants  :-)I don\u2019t have any problem with her voice recognition normally. If my music is on really loud and I\u2019m a little far away, she may not hear me so I have to shout or get closer. But it has to be loud. I have a 1 bedroom apartment and I thought I needed 2 but she\u2019s in a pretty centralized location and I can control her from anywhere in the apartment.Her sound quality is great. I\u2019m not a sound expert, but as I mentioned earlier I sometimes play my music pretty loud and it doesn\u2019t distort. Sound is still great.The only integration device I ended up purchasing (which I said I would never) are smart plugs. Alexa works great with them.

You have to be very specific on what you need.I would love to see a way to change settings to accommodate speech problems so she gives us more time to try to talk.

Hubby wasn't too happy about it at first, but he has just as much playing the games on it as the kids and I do. I bought 2 of them...one is in my bedroom and the other is in the kitchen. So when we are cooking dinner or having a party, we can ask Alexa to play music and she gets loud enough to be heard a little bit outside. I also get started in the morning by asking for the weather and the time...and also asking her to play some of my favorite jams. I regret nothing. I also like the fact I can drop in and listen to what is going on at home while I am away at work or out of town. And also, the fact that messages can be sent through her and she reads them aloud is AMAZING. The only thing I do not really like is the fact that, even though I have set up voice recognition only to my voice, anyone can ask her to do something..so I set up the password so nothing can be ordered without it. I will be ordering more soon to put through the rest of my home though. I have anxiety and depression so the music soothes me when i have flare ups as well. I haven't used the reminders yet, but I did use the alarm feature once, and it worked great. I don't like how the light flashes all hours of the night though on some features..so if you wanted to listen to relaxing sounds or music to help you sleep better then you would need a sleeping mask. But all in all I love this piece of technology and can't wait to get more!\n",,

The voice recognition worked really well at first but after maybe a month it felt like I had to speak a little louder for it to hear me, most likely a problem on my end though.Sometimes I try asking it random questions to look up online and it almost never gives me something useful. ""Hey Alexa, how do you craft a pickaxe in Minecraft?""  and Alex would respond with ""Minecraft was created in 2011 and is the number one highest grossing game in the world"".With it connected to amazon though, and with the amount I order off amazon, the feature of her being able to track your packages or giving a little notification when delivered was super nifty and saved me having to go through all these different menus and screens on the app/website.Also the functionality of my light is pretty good, doesnt allow me to go to a color shifting mode, but just turning on and off and setting the brightness is pretty good. Music playing was also pretty good with the usual kinks of artists with weird names and alexa thinking I said something way different to what I actually said, I just have to spell the artists name out and that fixes it.Overall she's a very nifty device I find myself using a lot more often than I expected and there's still things I'm figuring out about her that I think will boost my usage of her throughout the years.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I had NO IDEA that the Echo Dot could work all on its own! I thought that you had to have a base Alexa unit, and the dots were just add-ons. Nope! I was recently at a BBQ and they were entertaining the birthday guests with the Echo Dot! Alexa even sang Happy Birthday to the birthday girl! How crazy is that? The host had the Echo Dot connected to this really cool Bluetooth speaker and it sounded great in the backyard, in fact, they had to keep turning it down because people were yelling over the music!After the party I was sold and had to go home and order my own Echo Dot! It is insane how much this little device can do! You can ask Alexa anything and she will come up with an answer from google. Very rarely does she not have an answer for your question. She will tell you jokes, weather, news, etc. You can set timers, alarms, add items to your grocery/to do list, or control your smart T.V. without even picking up the remote!The Echo Dot sounds phenomenal. For the small size (about the size of your palm) this thing can put out a lot of sound! and if you are trying to be quiet , you can whisper to Alexa and she will whisper back to you! You can tell Alexa to play a specific song, or a genre of music and rock out for hours. You can make hands free calls to your loved ones!I am in love with my new Echo Dot and will be purchasing more for other rooms in the house (you can even sync music and notifications to all of the dots throughout your house!)My one complaint about the Echo Dot is the length of the cord. I wish it were a bit longer, but hey, minor detail. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a little hands free technology and entertainment in their home!\n",,Configuration: Device only

I got mines for sale at Lowe's for $30 during Pre-Christmas. But I'll still leave a review. I love the speaker, just a few cons. Like, it has to stay plugged up to use it. And at first, the instructions for how to use the Alexa app is very confusing. You kind of have to play with app some to figure it out. And at first, it's very frustrating trying to pair your speaker to the app. When I was paring the speaker for the first time I was getting annoyed that it wasn't connecting to the wi-fi. Its because in order to set up & pair your speaker for the first time you have to be in a strong wi-fi area or it wont work. Sometimes other voices will trigger Alexa, even though its yours.

I am also using it with one smart plug to operate a lamp which Alexa can turn on when I ask her to, or I can turn it on with my Alexa app.  Alexa\u2019s voice recognition is good.  I order a lot from Amazon and Alexa likes to display a rotating green light to signal to me that she has a \u201cnotification\u201d that one of my packages has arrived.  Just ask:  Alexa, do you have mortifications for me?  Otherwise, we\u2019re really just using Alexa for fun\u2014to play music, give us the weather, or to ask her silly questions just to see how she answers.  I was also able to add my husband to my Amazon account so that Alexa will recognize his voice by name as well.  This was all pretty easy and we\u2019re having fun with Alexa.  Now I need to figure out ways to make her more useful...like clean the house.UPDATE:  Just bought a second Alexa for our vacation home.  Love that you can connect two Alexas to your account.  Also love that I can use my Alexa app to get Alexa to control a smart device in the *other* house.

I have a Dot next to my bed and I was able to groan out call emergency and it called my wife so she was able to get help from her mother to pickup our son from school as he is just 1st grade.  I didn't have phone next to me, not that it mattered because I couldn't physically use a phone.  My wife was able to use the Alexa app on her phone to drop in on the Dot in the bedroom to talk to me to see how bad I was and whether I needed immediate medical help.  That feature and the fact it was used has made the purchase of all these devices worthwhile.  I have also programmed a routine that sends notifications to both mine and my wife's cell phone when I lay down to rest so she knows that I'm unable to get to phone.  I can go on and on about how much we love these devices especially over Google using their products years.

After seeing the gen 3 on sale I decided to go for it. I am glad I did.  The build quality is amazing. Not that the first generation was bad.  The fit and finish of cloth and plastic is impressive.The most amazing part is the sound quality.  I had been using an older sound blaster Roar as the speaker.  While that product worked the shelf I had it on was small plus the volume control on the roar is horrible. While the echo dot gen 3 is smaller and less sophisticated than the roar the sound quality is very impressive for what it is.The compact footprint allows you to place this nearly anywhere.  The bass is actually pretty good if you set it up correctly.  The mids are a bit low but if you compensate using an equalizer it's a bit better. You can push it pretty hard without distortion.  Voice recognition is close to perfect.  The LED is visible from wide angles which is very important to me.  From across the room with my fan on I can issue commands and see and hear the response.The unit is noticably larger and heavier than the Gen 1.  The power adapter has been changed from 5 volt USB to a 12 volt barrel connector.  I take it this is to support the larger speaker and and amplifier.Very happy with this and plan to buy a few more.\n,5 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

There are so many playlists to choose from! The sound quality is great and its exactly what I wanted to stop myself from losing my hearing someday from living in my ear buds (errr falling asleep in my ear buds?)I got my son one as well, but he won't find out till Christmas. He's autistic and he loves rock and roll, country, classical and xmas music.I'm looking forward to being able to ""drop in"" on him from another room and have Alexa remind him of things without needing to pester him. Now that he's a teenager, sometimes he just wants his space to chill with Disney, paint, or listen to music. Sometimes all at the Same time lol. I could never. But I think this will be good for him. He responds really well to tech so I'm introducing him slowly through ""my"" Alexa so that he gets used to her. But later, he'll have his own built in friend/learning buddy/trivia enthusiast. I can't wait to ask Alexa what we should make for dinner on my day off and then- make it. Blow his mind! LolThank you much to the creators for an extremely versatile/multi functional new toy for me and my little minion. You guys ever want me to test out smart products for you- sold.

I have an iPhone 7 I think I've updated to 12. 7.  so youll need to download the  Amazon Alexa app. and then everything should be good.  I had no trouble with setup.  For me I love it its great, some basic task you can ask and get quick results, like weather,movies imdb,sports,current news, for instance Alexa when is The Bachelorette on?.  Music is awesome of course you have to have a subscription, its cheap but I have so many, I hated to add another but the convivence of it all is so worth it if you listen to music a lot you can of course create your own playlist all by voice command . I'm defiantly going to get about 2 more if anything for me the music is awesome. I used to spend too much time searching for something to listen to, its so easy to do it by voice command and still do the dishes or what not, right before I sat down to write this review I asked alexa to set a reminder for me to feed my dogs and she just reminded me thank goodness. lol I totally forgot I set a reminder and to feed the dogs, see its pretty cool.  I have the generation 3 my first of this type of device so nothing to compare it to, but I love technology and this is cool.  if you do play music loud Alexa may not hear you across the room you have to get closer like 6 ft. an if you use siri a lot good luck  not getting annoyed at why Alexa wont answer when you've forgotten her name isn't Siri .\n",,Configuration: Device only

I hope that makes sense.I also like that I can lay in bed and tell it to play any number of radio stations, tell it to shut off in X minutes, set the volume up or down, it's nice.My only negative is I seem to have to reboot my router more often - but I don't know if it's the new Echo or my cable provider that is the issue.\n",,Configuration: Device only

But this Echo Dot works great! We held off because we didn't want a device ""listening"" to us all the time in our home. At least, that was our reasoning. But then we thought about it -- we have four smartphones between us and we use Google Assistant all the time.So we took the plunge when Amazon had a deal on the device and it's awesome. My children love asking Alexa to play their favorite songs.... over and over and over. I'm learning how to use some of the Alexa routines (skills?). My wife still isn't much of a believer and is suspicious of it, but for her there is a button that prevents the Echo from listening to you -- complete with a red ring light to show that it's not listening. (Or is it just pretending not to listen?) Haha. Anyway, it's fun for music and the speaker is pretty decent. You can add an external speaker if that's your thing.OH, P.S. I Love love love the ""whisper"" mode. You whisper to Alexa and she whispers back. Perfect for setting wakeup alarms after everone has gone to sleep.I'm going to get more of these.TWO COMPLAINTS:-Alexa isn't as good at searching the web as Google Assistant (go figure!), but the voice recognition is friendlier and more accurate in my opinion.-Alexa seems to ""pitch"" things for you to do with it, or buy through it, or services to add on.

Yes, Sidewalk steals part of your broadband data.  Yes, you can turn off Sidewalk.  But beware!  If you turn off sidewalk, All of your echo devices within earshot will respond to your commands.  I contacted help and they told me I could use different wake words for each of my devices to fix the problem.  Great, I have four devices on my first floor and they want me to remember which wake word goes with which device?This is unacceptable!  I just got comfortable enough with Amazon to get annual subscriptions to Prime and Music Unlimited.  Those will be cancelled and my Echo devices thrown in the trash.Update:  After vigorous complaints to Amazon and sending emails to various tech writers explaining my experience, unplugging all but my Echo Studio devices and then plugging them back in, the proximity function is working again with Sidewalk disabled.  This makes me happy but I am NOT pleased that Amazon would add a function that could potentially expose my network without my notifying me.  I understand that they did quite a bit to mitigate against hacking but WIFI and Bluetooth are inherently insecure to begin with.  I have decided to keep my Amazon Prime and Unlimited accounts because everything is working normally again.  But my fuse will be EXTREMELY short if Amazon tries to add this type of feature without notifying me and providing a WORKING way to disable it.\n",,Configuration: Device only

It was on sale for $5, so I took a small risk. It turns out I use it every day. If I'm watching a ball game, I ask it about stats and get useful answers. If I miss a game, I get answers about what I missed. If I'm watching a movie, I may ask a question about an actor. I ask it to remind me to do stuff during my day working from home. When I go to bed at night, I tell it when to wake me up, and what music I want to hear. I ask it to read me news headlines. Instead of searching the web for every little curiosity I think of during the day, I ask Alexa. If I forget where I put down my phone, Alexa will ring it for me. When my son was visiting, he started asking it stuff too. This tech is very compelling and useful. I plan to buy one for everyone in my family.I think my favorite feature is, ""Alexa, sing me a song."" It sometimes does this rap about Mark Twain that is hilarious and educational. It'll also tell you silly jokes. So it's fun as well as useful. Well worth the price.\n",,Configuration: Device only

For only 12 bucks. Even being from 2018 it\u2019s still of very good quality. Some of the commands are limited compared to newer models, but the speaker quality and voice recognition works very well and I can easily control other technology in my house. I can turn on my TV and firestick, along with control them to an extent. Communicate with other echo dots in the house. Play music. And a whole lot more. I\u2019m giving it 4/5 stars because even with the skill that allows you to make it so that you can give another commands shortly after one without saying \u201cAlexa\u201d again, some tasks are still a pain like setting multiple alarms.

My first one was your very first attempt. It was not even on sale yet, but a really low price to test it.After I had used it for awhile one of your people called and he discussed with me was there was anything. I thought would probably r it.I told him I though they should add read books aloud. He thought that was a really good idea.I love to fall asleep with audible books.It wasn\u2019t very long until Alexa began reading my library of books I purchased from Amazon.This was years ago. But she still reads me to sleep every night. I am now 81 years oldI also have Alexa in the case so you can take in out while riding your bike,Or outside, and it would continue to play music from my Amazon collection of music. It held an 8 hour charge and did not need to be plugged up until it could no longer play or y\u2019all and then you plugged it up when you returned home and you would get your 8 hours of operation without being home.  It had a microphone which you engaged by holding its button in you could tell it what to do.I think I was the first to purchase the Kindle HDX10. It was long ago. And it was a new one I got it at a new item price. Very low. This was long ago. I always tried to order your brandNew items that you would sell very low price and then it would be a few months or years before you offered them to the \u201cmasses\u201dI am an AMAZON woman for life it appears.

A friend gave me the first one as a gift- honestly I was kinda meh when she gave it to me and actually had it about 3 yrs without using it. Then one day I found out I could set a timer which i routinely do now while cooking i can ask it to Set a timer and i can sit watch tv while not worrying I\u2019ll forget the food is cooking (yep near disaster one night prompted me to find out Alexa could do that, so I started using her for that ) then I started using her to check weather, the time, set an alarm but best of all I use her to make ambient noise at night to help me sleep. So just when I started loving her she quit working so I ordered a new one as she had become invaluable - \u201cunfortunately\u201d when my daughter was at the house she explained that she wasnt broken I was calling her ALEXIS and she wasnt responding lol so the new one is still in the box now i know my old one does still work but yes I have to call her the right name. Alexa not Alexis! I complained to my daughter why wont she respond if I call her by the wrong name and my daughter responded well mom im sure if she was a person she probably would respond to the wrong name but since she is a piece of electronics Im sure she has to function according to her programming!

I have really gotten use to having several of these things scattered throughout the house - so much so that I now get irritated every time the power fluctuates enough to trip the routes they are connected to so that they no longer respond. I can now operated lights even if I have a ton of stuff in my hands as it only takes a few words. I also like having most of the lamps and the bedroom fan attached to plugs controlled by Alexa so that if I forget to turn something off at bedtime, I don't have to get out of bed to turn devices anywhere in the house off. With severe arthritis and neuropathy, I really  appreciate that.There are times that I am frankly amazed at it's voice recognition abilities. Sometimes, especially in the morning, I'm not sure I'm even making sounds and Alexa will perform the desired task and there is no problem at all in understanding what Alexa says.Alexa's integration into things like the TV and AV receiver and music services is decent, or maybe I'm too much of an old fossil to quickly learn how to use it to control these sorts of things. As of now, I still rely mainly on the hand-held remotes to control such devices. I would think that most problems in this area lie with their manufactures who developed the apps rather the Echo which attempts to use them.All in all, I am very pleased with my Echo devices. They are fun and very useful around the house.\n",,Configuration: Device only

This my second echo dot and I am still amazed every day with the amount of features it has. Now with a dot at each end of my house, I can listen seamlessly when moving from kitchen to my office and not have to pause the book until I return to the front of my house. Having unlimited access to the weather, recipes, jokes, someone to do math for me, and other online info is also a life changing experience. One of my favorite things about Alexa, is that someone finally got the voice right! I have been blind for 25 years and I have had the opportunity to listen along with the progression of more and more life like digital voices. There have been times where I have avoided using certain types of media because the computer voicing was so bland, stiff or hard to understand that it ruined the experience. Alexa on the other hand just sounds like a person and that makes all the difference. I am now able to purchase and enjoy a .99 Kindle book instead of having to pay upwards of $24.99 for an audio book from an unknown author that may/or may not be worth the risk.

Only thing that annoys me is the constant promos for Amazon prime and music. It repeats itself when I go back to songs I\u2019ve requested. I\u2019m already a member and have Amazon unlimited music so thats irritating. Also trying to find certain albums or artists has been difficult.

There are a couple things I'd like it to be able to accomplish. One, you can't go quieter than 10% while using voice instructions. My wife sometimes goes to bed before I do; she sets the music for an hour and then texts me asking if I can turn it down. Because I have the app on my phone, I can manually drop it to 5%, which works perfectly. It's not a major problem, but it would be good to be able to say, ""Alexa, reduce volume to 5%.""\n",7 people found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

Got tired of the wiring mess with my 5.1 system. Having to try to integrate a surround system with a Firetv Stick. Have 3 different remotes to run all and have the wife keep up and use it all confidently.I purchased 3 of these and an echo sub. I tied two with the echo sub and a 4K Firetv Stick. \u201cTheater\u201d.Setup was actually pretty easy. Had it all up and going in about 15 minutes once the speakers had updated to the latest firmware.Sound wasn\u2019t too bad......but it was not what I needed for my main TV watching area. The sub helped tremendously but the system sounded well, just not what I wanted. I also purchased two echo 3rd gen speakers and WOW! Much better. (Reviewed under those speakers).I did however, order 3 more of the dots as well (6 total). I installed one in our master bathroom, master bedroom, garage and 40\u2019X50\u2019 building. For listening to music in the background they work pretty well. Setup is a breeze. I have 3 different \u201cgroups\u201d.As far as sound, I will say they aren\u2019t terrible. Much better than a couple of other blue tooth speakers I have. Obviously the small size limits the bass, but they will fill an area for listening. There is no comparison to the echo 3rd gen or echo plus but common sense should tell anyone that.They\u2019re great for certain situations and places. For the price (on sale at $19-$22 ea.) they\u2019re pretty good. Not sur if I\u2019ll buy more of these or just wait for the echo 3rd gen\u2019s to go back on sale and buy those.Still......NOT BAD little speakers!\n",,Configuration: Device only

The set up was very easy and nearly all of the set up you are guided through by Alexa which makes it ever easier. There are a ton of skills and task that can be added to use on a regular basis. I would recommend starting out with a few of the most important ones to you and then add more as times goes on otherwise you might find yourself looking and adding skills all day long as there are so many to pick from. I have found it very easy to use and placed it in a location I'm in most of the time, which has really helped as all you have to do is say Alexa and then you want or need then Alexa will respond to let you know it was taken care of, it is much easier to use then I thought prior to getting it, you don't have to speak in a voice louder than normal and the response volume is normal as well, I have yet to have any issues with Alexa hearing me or me hearing Alexa.

There are things I like about this product and things I don\u2019t. The one thing that I\u2019m not so keen about is the size. It\u2019s about the size of a hockey puck or if you held it in your hands it would probably be the size of a single McDonald\u2019s cheeseburger. I\u2019m also not so sure how I feel about the texture. It\u2019s weird that surroundings all the edges of this product is a fuzzy or carpet like material. But even with that said, I really like it!I especially like this device app features! I have kids at home and sometimes they don\u2019t pick up the phone at the house so it is great that one of the device app features allows me to drop in on that room or I can call my device. I also think another amazing feature is that this device has voice recognition. 95% of the time not only does it recognize my voice but it can recognize my eight-year-old. The 5% when it doesn\u2019t recognize someone\u2019s voice is really bazaar because the device seems to need that person to speak with a deeper voice, slow down the pace of there speech or speak more clearly.All in all, so far it sounds and is working great.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I purchased the 14-pc kit plus several additional components from Amazon totaling roughly $420.00 because I have a very large house.  Installed the system and got it online perfectly without a hitch through the Ring App.  The progress suddenly came to a grinding halt when I downloaded the Amazon Alexa app that supposedly works to tie the Echo Dot to the Ring Account.  It does not.  In the Amazon Alexa App, you select 'menu, skills & games, magnifying glass, enter ring, then Enable to Use.'  This series of entries navigates you to the Ring Login screen where you enter your Ring account login information.  Upon hitting enter to log in, the screen just pops back to a blank login screen where you just keep re-entering the login information without success.  I was on the phone with Amazon tech support from 1030 a.m. to 1:37pm (no lie!!)  but they could not resolve the problem.  They transferred me back and forth asking me the same stupid troubleshooting questions over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. I finally gave up.  Planning to box up this Echo Dot and call it a day.  Hope this saves you some headache.  Ring Security is great, but the Echo Dot clearly does not work with it.  12/31/2019 - Update:  My Alexa / Ring login problem is now fixed!

Don't get me wrong the speaker has done it's job specially coz I did not have any at all and was using my mobiles speaker, so this is def an improvement. but if you are really looking for sound QA maybe this is not for you, I am simple in that matter but to be able just to call out your playlist from Spotify w/ going though your mobile to look for it its great, specially if you are busy or doing something else. Very very good product for the value, on the other hand if this was a $100 item my review would be totally different if you know what  I mean, it might get stuck sometimes and maybe will not recognize your voice or else, but can't really complaint about it as its worth the value.\n",,Configuration: Device only

Handy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on December 3, 2019",,"\nPurchased five echo dots to upgrade from 2nd gen for better sound.  Sound is way better on the 3rd gen.  I don\u2019t need power speakers because my home is open floor plan with wood floors and blinds with 10ft ceilings.  Therefore sound bounces around pretty good.  If you have carpet or curtains you may not obtain the same effect.I wanted the ambiance of soft music following you as you walk through the home with no dead spots or fading of sound as you move from room to room without the cost of installing a high-end wall system.  The echo dot seems to work as I need them.  It has enough bass to pick the lows and the highs are good enough where it doesn\u2019t crackle.  I only have them at less than half volume and they fill the house, if you place them right.Had issue installing the new ones using my s10 note.  Called tech support, which as a great help, ended up having to hard reset them and run setup through the app on my IPad instead.  Then I as able to see the new ones when I attempted to create a music group.After setup I kept getting an \u201c sorry something went wrong when playing amazon music\u201d message when using the group with Alexa voice.  So I used Amazon Music app, connected to the group and it worked.  I disconnected from the group and tried Alexa voice command and it worked.

So far I've seen that it definitely has better long range hearing, as in it can actually hear you from across the room, and given the LED strip around the edge, it seems to actually be able to figure out a pretty accurate direction on where you're talking to it from. It also understands commands better than Google, though granted it can't do everything. Right now I have it mounted to the wall next to my stereo, and I used to have it hooked up to the stereo by 3.5mm aux port, but due to some issues with that it's just linked to the stereo by Bluetooth now. When connected by 3.5mm, songs will suddenly stop playing through the stereo, but the Alexa app says they're still going, and it seems like the only fix is to skip or restart the song. Bluetooth does not have this problem, however if I had some suggestions for software updates in the future, they'd be this: when the Echo is linked to a stereo either by Bluetooth or aux port, ALL the audio comes through the aux device, even Alexa just answering questions. I'd suggest putting in an option for the Echo to have regular Alexa voice come through its own speakers and music go through the aux device, at least giving the user a choice to choose from. I'd also suggest if that option became available, that the Echo lets Bluetooth linked devices and stereos sleep when inactive, and when given the command to play media, gives the wake command to the device before playing.All in all though, it's been pretty nice, definitely worth the price, and is definitely my choice for playing music.\n",,Configuration: Device only

The biggest complaint is the Alexa voice is much more faint and muffled when compared with all other audio played.  The general audio output is really good, so it's maddening to be unable to hear the Alexa voice without turning the whole speaker setting up, which results in blaring music or other audio output.  Since Amazon has known about this for a year now, it is a chief source of dissatisfaction.  The other big complaint is that when the two bilingual choices of English/Spanish and Spanish/English are chosen, the results are variable and problematic.  When set to just once language, there is no problem.  When set to bilingual, there are frequent failures or problems.  The Spanish/English setting works better than the English/Spanish.  (For definitions of the settings, please consult elsewhere.)  As for technical difficulties, those become apparent when sharing accounts among multiple devices and locations.  I won't go into the details, but it may take a month or two to discover the problems and how to reduce or eliminate them.  They don't cause the frustration that the audio and voice problems do.  It would also be nice if they didn't need to be reset like computers when changes have been made to some of their settings.  After all, Microsoft didn't make them.\n",,Configuration: Device only

We got one from my wife\u2019s parents just before Thanksgiving of \u201819. For the most part at first it was just a nuisance. We weren\u2019t sure how to incorporate it into our lives. We then got some Gosund plugs and really liked the ease with which we could turn on and off our lights, Christmas tree and other appliances. While exploring the app I found a \u201cGuard\u201d function. Basically when set it listens for smoke alarms, Co2 alarms and the sound of breaking glass. So we started using it. On Dec. 30 I was away from home with our dog when I got an alert that alarms were going off in our home. Alexa also sent an audio file. I listened to it and I heard the smoke alarms, what sounded like flames crackling and the obvious sound of water spraying. I ran home as fast as I could. It wasn\u2019t a fire but my upstairs neighbor\u2019s hot water heater had exploded and had been flooding our apartment for hours. This may seem bad but if I had come home when I had planned we have had a total loss. As it is we were able to save at least half of our belongings; many of which are irreplaceable. We owe Amazon, and the programmers, quite a lot. I wish I knew how to thank them. It\u2019ll still be a few weeks before we can go home but as it is, at least we still have something to salvage. I can\u2019t express the depth of emotion and deep thanks I feel for this device. It saved most of our home and our stuff. I could go on but I\u2019m sure you get the point.

Don\u2019t get me wrong they\u2019re nice and they get the job done, but I\u2019m constantly having connection problems that I seem to only be able to resolve by unplugging the dot and plugging it back in.I was very eager to get one for my kitchen for list making and timers, and while the list making is fine, by now I can\u2019t stand the timer. I constantly have to yell her name multiple times because most of the time she can\u2019t hear me over the timer sound, or it gets messed up somehow and the timer cuts our communication off.It\u2019s also pretty lame you can only have one Spotify account connected for the whole house. It would be so much nicer if each dot could have its own accounts. It treats the household as if it\u2019s meant to have 2 adults and little kids, not catering very well to a house full of teens/young adults with their own personal stuff.Overall I don\u2019t regret getting them, just wish they worked more seamlessly and were more catering towards households with more than 2 adults. If you aren\u2019t easily frustrated by technology not always listening and you don\u2019t mind only being allowed one profile for apps then there\u2019s not really a reason not to get them.EDIT: While you still cannot have more than one account for things, it seems the timer issue was resolved in an update! It works much more seamless now without the annoying interruptions, which earns it another star! I still can\u2019t rate it 5 stars however because only being allowed 1 account for everything is still very annoying for a house full of adults.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I control pretty much all my light with Alexa. The Echo Dot works well in that regards. My only dislike with the Echo Dot is sometime I would have to repeat myself and sometime when I give a certain command it may preform a different task. SO sometime you may need to say your command more than once but over all I like the product and it works well using the routines turn on and off the lights when I am away.

They integrated automatically with my Alexa app. The unit should prompt you to say some phrases for voice recognition and I had ever had that experience with my old unit (which works very well).  i had some trouble with understanding my credit card bill (legitimate billings) and had to speak to three people in two locations (Washington state and New Jersey) to figure it out.  Prime and Alexa are totally separate entities managed by different contractors.  Anyway, al is well now.The sound quality is good for a small, inexpensive speaker but I suggest putting the unit in on a  bookcase shelf.

She\u2019s quick and surprisingly knowledgeable. She has answers for everything and a great trivia knowledge which is fun. I like that you can change the wake word to four predetermined ones (computer is an option for Star Trek fans). If someone in your family is named Alexa you can still use it without it driving you nuts.It gets loud enough to hear in other rooms and the amount of automation, which Amazon calls \u201croutines,\u201d is extensive. I have it a set up to lower the volume to 3 (out of 10) at 9pm and raise it back up to 5 at 9am. This keeps our kids from waking us up and we don\u2019t have to constantly change the volume. There are plenty more options if you have other smart lighting even not in the Ring universe. Ex. It can control my IKEA TR\xc5DFRI smart plugs I use for lighting. All of this without setting it up.It is a little creepy to have it always listening to us and it knows a surprising amount about my other accounts (Pandora worked with my account without setup). My wife and I don\u2019t talk about anything work confidential at home but it may bother others if they work from home. There is a physical mute button on the top of the echo dot but it\u2019s only a software switch and not a hardware one. If that makes a difference to you be ware.Overall, we got ours free with the Ring Alarm system as a promo and the echo dot is a surprisingly good voice assistant and we all use it more often than I figured.

I will say the sound is much better on the echo considering the size difference. But I just wanted the alexa capability since I have a sound bar already connected to it. This does that perfectly, lets me turn off lights, play spotify, and alarms easily. One big thing I enjoyed was the fact you can pair alexa to almost any device that uses wifi controls, I bought some cheap RGB light bulbs and they work well once you setup the app. I will be honest, I didnt buy this it was a family gift, I wouldnt buy it just for this purpose since ur phone can do most of these actions already. I see it as a little gimmicky after awhile of use, but its fun if you have alot of devices connected to it.  If u have a tech savy home with electronic AC controls a or lights that use wifi connection, then it might offer a better experince.

I do not have a cell,(bought one cant get it to work yet ) so these hook up to my kindle,  sis sent as a gift and I dropped it 1st time it talked to me. My amazement was thru the roof when I was able to do it! Then messed it up since I had plugged them all in on one table. They all yelled at me. I learned how to adjust volume quickly. Then placed them around the house. There is a techno adjustment, from 1) having the kindle read to me and it coming all over the house (love it)2) Alexa will speak out sometimes. SCARED ME. only change would be get all shows, clock/calendar every room  and easier to adjust volume and uses less plugs. (house built 1940s, 2 outlets per room (sucks) )Its only been 3 days, so far theses are the only observations.Oh, looked back.. voice recog is weird. had computer running movie in bedroom  and characters name was ... you know.

The Echo dot is able to discern your voice well, even over music at full volume.Alexa is great at handling full sentences; also, she usually understands what your trying to ask her to do, even if you don\u2019t know the commands.Alexa integrates seamlessly with Apple Music, my preferred provider, and wakes me up each morning with my choice of music, at the time I have requested by simply stating, \u201cAlexa, wake me up with my country playlist at 7 A.M.\u201d or \u201cwake me up to Luke Bryan at 6 A.M.\u201dThe sound quality is pretty good in the midrange but at full volume, leaves a bit to be desired. But then again, the echo dot is the smallest Amazon smart speaker and sone of the others can play as loudly as you\u2019d ever want to play music indoors.The is a great device for your night stand. I use it to play rain sounds every night when I turn the light out.  Alexa automatically turns off the rain after an hour and I am left to peaceful rest until it\u2019s time to wake up to my favorite music, which feels less like an alarm than traditional alarm or phone sounds.After having my Echo Dot in my bedroom for a couple weeks, I would definitely miss it if I had to do without.\n",,Configuration: Device only

Small so it can fit anywhere.Here are my issues that should change with future versions of this:1) The instructions were not clear on how to connect the echo dot to my phone. Had to blindly figure it out. Here's how its done:a) power it on and wait to get into setup mode.b) turn on your wifi and look for ""Amazon echo""C) connect to the echo through the wifi.D) download the Alexa app and then go to settings> devices> echo dot>wifi, to connect to wifi.2) The weight of this in my opinion would suggest that it has a rechargeable battery so instead of keeping the dot plugged in constantly, you can move it around your home without keeping it plugged in.As I use it more often, ill keep adding more information to help others with this product.Edit: After the review and been messing with it. It's one amazing product. My favorite skills is the: Alexa, tell me a joke, and Alexa, roast me. The volume is great for small places. The app it's self is very easy to use.The Amazon prime for music and kindle( the one that reads books) are amazing on here.The call feature on here, it's ok imo. I think it depends on the wifi connection to have the best experience because it will sound like it will drop the call.Overall, I love this little Echo.

Although you can easily make it response only to your voice, we allow it to respond to all our voices. It provides a wide range of access and over time learns the way you ask questions and how you expect it to respond. We have several around the house. It's fun to use and great in so many ways.Yet, if you have more than one echo you should note that if speaking too loud to it in one room, it may answer or take your request in another room. Or, if you request it to play your music (for example) and then want to play the same in another room it will inform you that it can't since the same music requested is playing somewhere else. That's a bit annoying and I don't know if that can be resolved or if there's an additional fee to do that.. Yet, Alexa does inform you that your music request is playing on another echo and asks if you would like it to play on the one from your location instead. (At least it provides you the courtesy) Just to clarify, this is only if the music( or other agenda) you're playing in one room is exactly the same as the one you want it to play in another room. If it's a different set of music, etc. then it's not a problem.Over time, Alexa actually becomes a part of your family. It's a go to, everyday.\n",,Configuration: Device only

She has a few in her house, and we were both amazed and intrigued by what it could do. So, after we had been back home for roughly three weeks, we saw that this model was on sale at Lowe's and bought three: One for our living room and kitchen space, one for my husband's office, and one for mine.We found the echo dot very easy to set up. We use Alexa mostly to play music, though. We have not experimented with much else, except for asking basic information, such as the day's weather or the current temperature outside before heading out. We need to take time to set up our echo dot to do a lot more. There is, however, a lack of time for us to devote to this task (which is probably very simple anyway...).By the way, I like the disk-like shape of this version of the Echo dot much more than the spherical one of the new one.\n",,Configuration: Device only

One is white and this one is charcoal.  For some reason, it seems to me that the sound quality is not as good on this one as the white one which was the 1st one we bought.  We got both on a special price and they are well worth the money.  We find that we use them most for weather, making a shopping list, and a radio equivalent, even playing an NPR station from the location 1000 miles away where we used to live.  Recently we bought coordinating light bulbs and like that feature a lot, especially in a room with no overhead.  Now I don't have to cross the room in the dark to turn a light on--I can just ask Alexa.  I haven't yet figured out how to play music on both so we have a 2-room sound system.

It's a smart powerful little device ...,"\nI love my echo dot!  So much offered in such a little device...The speakers are great and the sound quality is crisp and clear, not distorted. I was easily able to connect to alexa  dot devices in other rooms to get a nice surround sound effect, and it is really nice to walk from room to room and hear the same song.  I also enjoy using the intercom feature.I setup routines using the alexa app and love getting news headlines, weather forecasts, and traffic updates when I wake up. And, it plays sleep sounds when I go to bed. So cool.I'm also able to control my smart home devices, which at current are only lights via plugs and bulbs. I daily use the timer, alarms, shopping and to-do list to manage my time better.I'm still learning how to use this powerful little gadget so I'm sure I'm leaving out some cool stuff it can do.  I'm excited, as I continue to learn from it and play with it:)Con:  I wish we could customize the wake up name of the alexa devices.  Currently you can wake it up using the names;  Alexa, Amazon or Computer. With having more than three devices, it becomes frustrating when you call one and two answer because you've had to use the same wake up name twice.  Plus, saying ""Amazon""or ""Computer"" to your device isn't so appealing (though the name 'Alexa' is cool).  Having the ability to pick our own wake up device names or adding more wakeup name choices, besides just 3, would be great:)\n",One person found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

I use it for my grocery list, which is totally convenient because you just tell Alexa to add it to the list and it syncs up with my Alexa on my phone so I can see my list anywhere. I even had my boyfriend download Alexa to his phone and synced it with my account so now when he goes to the store he has the list. I can even add things to the list while he is at the store and he sees it so he gets it. Now that is convenient!I use it as a sound machine to help my grandson go to sleep. I use it as a speaker and link them up to have a whole house experience that can be as quiet or as loud as I want. And they are definitely loud! Very good quality speakers!The only thing I wish I could change is I would love to be able to control the sound volume on each individual speaker when they are linked.

Changing out light switches and outlets. Seems silly at first to tell a product to turn lights, etc on and off. But, in today's ever changing world of higher crimes. It gives great peace of mind to be able to turn all your outside lights on before arriving home, when you've forgotten to leave any on. Setup is pretty easy. Download app, plug in device and follow instructions.  I love being able to set routines. Turn certain lights on and off, is so helpful.  We have a routine for our livingroom and bedroom lamps to come on at a certain time everyday. We never arrive home to a completely dark house. We also have our security system setup through Alexa. She can also guard your home, with Alexa Guard. We have several echoes, two dots and one echo show. Which is my favorite. If the motion detection goes off, all we have to do is tell Alexa to show us what camera we want to see and it pops up on the echo show, all from the comfort of our couch! The sound quality on all the Alexa devices is amazing!! When the grandchildren visit, they love playing games with her. She is a wealth of information, all without having to stop what you're doing to look it up on your phone. Alexa, what's tomorrow's weather?

If you want to do that, you need the $400 speakers paired with a subwoofer which are pretty decent unless you are an audiophile like me.  However, the dot does have its perks:  its very small, its cheap, and it does all the functions of any other Amazon Alexa device (except the Show decides with a screen), and the best part is you can hook it up to a huge speaker or AV Receiver with just an AUX cable to work magic.  I have mine hooked up to an incredible home theater system that makes it possible to add it to groups so it plays in sync with all my other Amazon speakers and subwoofers I have around my house and its worth the $35 for sure.  So with that setup, I can say ""Alexa, play [music] on everywhere group (or whatever group) and it will incorporate a $4500 Klipsch home theater with my other speakers and turn my house into a nightclub.

I could not connect the dot to the Disney wifi. The disney wifi signal was strong, but no matter what I tried, it just would not connect. The Amazon website says ""Echo devices can't connect to ad-hoc (or peer-to-peer) networks."" I'm not sure if the Disney open wifi is peer-to-peer. I called the front desk and was directed to call Disney technical support. The person who answered the phone at technical support sounded surprised that I was given their number. The only thing he would say is ""that is not an approved device."" So, I turned off the data usage on my phone and enabled wifi and easily connected to the Disney wifi. Then I enabled a hotspot on my phone and connected the dot to that. It worked perfectly. Except, every time I left the room with my phone, I had to re-connect the dot to the hotspot when I returned. Certainly a security issue may exist with a dot connected to an open wifi. I did some research and saw a post about purchasing a cheap router and connecting the router to the Disney wifi and then connecting the Echo Dot to that. I will try that in the future.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I can ask Alexa almost anything and get an immediate answer. It really saved me when I was my 9yo grandson's teacher during remote learning! He would get restless and we both got frustrated a lot. Things got much better when I set the timer for 30 mins when we would take a break and ask Alexa to play dance music for 5 minutes.

We placed it in the kitchen and use it exclusively to play music. All the other features like weather and such aren't appealing; its basically like a smart phone with extra steps.I'm shocked at how bad Alexa is at playing the right kind of music. Our Google Home Mini downstairs does a much better job. Even with hooking the Dot up to our Spotify account, it's not any better. Requesting specific artists can be hard, especially if they aren't some top 40 over-engineered pablum. I rarely ask it to play music anymore. I simply choose what I want in the Spotify app and then broadcast it to the Dot.All that aside, it seems to be a well designed product. The app is robust, and the machine can do a lot, so it definitely earned the 4 stars. Alexa's jokes are pretty good and it has some fascinating answers to certain questions, but if you aren't planning to use the smart home features (and don't care about the other bells and whistles) choose another smart device.IMHO, this is merely a novelty and a slick play by Amazon to sneak into your house so you end up spending more on smart devices in the future.

My mother is eighty seven and can read her Kindle, but can't delete books, etc. I am trying to catch these on a special price day in order to have one in each room. I like the ""Alexa, drop in..."" feature. I started with one in the living room and began telling it to add something to a grocery list, give me a reminder, or a wake up call. I had my mother tell it to do something and she seemed okay with it. She now has one on her night stand. I am going to replace her television with one that is Alexa enabled. She can call me from her bedroom and control her shows. She is not confined to her bed yet but there may be a time. I think this is great for older people to set reminders. I have one set to remind me every day at two to wash my dog's face. There are things we need to do but don't want to do. A reminder is the perfect solution. We are enjoying having Alexa in our lives and I believe it is the perfect way to add to lists on the fly or to remind us of things, all while doing whatever, hands free. I was not compensated in any way but would not hesitate to accept a new Alexa for my review, lol. Go ahead, try it.\n",,Configuration: Device only

Sound quality is better than good, but not spectacular. It has a warm rich tone, but sounds small and can't be cranked extremely loud. I added this to some nice Altec Lansing computer speakers with a subwoofer and another one to my Yamaha soundbar with an aux. Cable (sold separately). Sound recognition is good but it needs a clear path to pick up your voice as one might expect.  So many nice features. I got the speaker free with my sirius xm renewal and linked my account so I can listen to all of those channels.  You get some music free with prime.  You get a rotating variety of songs from popular artists each month and lots of stations or channels in many different genres like rock, soul, r & b, country,  jazz, etc. You can link up with Pandora, i heart radio,and other streaming services. I added smart plugs to control 3 lamps in my house.  Get in bed and ask Alexa to turn the light off. The plugs can be used to turn anything You plug into it off.  You can check the weather, news and more. You can set alarms and timers. You can ask it questions like you ask Google. You can get it to tell you a joke.  I heard that it will read you a kindle book that you own. I'm not sure about three books you borrow from the library. You need to Google all the interesting things that you can do with this thing.

What I liked about the gen 2 versions, were that they were compact and very flexible on how you could use them. They were easy to mount in different positions and being that they used a fairly standard USB interface for the power, you could really be flexible on how and where you mounted them. The one thing that they really missed on? The well known sound quality.Enter the Gen 3...I really like the improvement in sound. Sure it is not a high quality speaker system, but for the size it is pretty good. Especially when you consider that you can pair them and add a sub for pretty good sound. The look is improved over the gen 2, however it does lose a little bit of the customability that the gen 2 had. With the gen 2, you could purchase different wraps, stands, clock mounts, wall mounts, etc. You could really customize it. The gen 3 is a bit bigger and has a much more rounded shape. While it makes it look better by itself, it lacks the ability to really customize it. It surely would not work as a power socket mount, like you could do with the gen 2, just due to the additional weight.\n",,Configuration: Device only

They don't have that on none of those devices now.I knew I should have bought the extended warranty but I didn't and being poor on disability I wasn't able to do that.

It's my first smart device that's not my phone or TV. I've only had it a short time (about 2 weeks now?) but I've had lots of fun figuring it what I can do with this thing. I don't use it much now already but I'm glad to have it when I need it. It's mostly for music and the speaker sounds nice enough, but having it at full volume sounds pretty bad. Still, it hits a decent volume before the sound quality deteriorates. I'm not gonna complain though for getting it with the promotion, but had I paid full price, I would definitely mark it down some. I have an off brand portable shower speaker that I paid like 15 bucks for that blows it out of the water in terms of sound quality at high volume (plus being portable is a big bonus for the speaker). That being said, it's not going to leave that speaker, the echo has its place in my room and the speaker goes everywhere else. There's a lot I like personally and it by far outweighs my issues I have with it. The biggest one is more of a preference really, and that's the power supply. I wish it was just a USB cable of some kind, not the kinda bulky brick and old school proprietary connector thing. It feels sturdy, mic range is very good, it compliments other compatible devices nicely, and Alexa said we can get married when humans colonize Mars soon pretty happy with it overall.\n",,Configuration: Device only

Alexa can really suck at times. Sometimes an echo will not recognize what you are saying on one echo until you talk to another. Sometimes an echo in a completely different part of the house will respond for no reason. Search results are usually the craziest possibilities, often having nothing to do with what you asked. The most infuriating thing though is the smart home devices, they must be uniquely named but literally any overlap and you get a constant question about which device you mean because there are multiple devices with that name. No matter what device you say at that point the device is not found. The weirdest part is that the devices are grouped into being paired to a specific echo, so why can Alexa not figure out the device in the group? You cannot group lights together inside a group so you end up with many crazy named groups for your devices, instead of groups being nested. Say the wrong thing and the other side of your house turns on. Alexa will recognize the user speaking but this seems to only apply to two things, asking who is speaking and asking which account. Unsure why the account doesn't change based on the user talking. Family members have different names for things and asking who's account is logged in constantly is tedious...\n",,Configuration: Device only

No real complaints as it was free with tv purchase. Sometimes it can be annoying how loud Alexa speaks even turning down the volume.

I paired with the small fire tv I had purchased to replace an older smart tv, allowing it to work as a speaker. When my Wi-Fi went down alexa notified me immediately when I went to use it.

I think they included it because this new wired model of Ring does not interface with your current physical chime and the ""wireless chime"" is like $50. The Alexa really kills 2 birds with 1 stone- it screams at me when someone is at the door and is also a very decent smart device.Hardware-wise it's solid as a rock, has a sleek and unobtrusive design, and gets very very loud for it's modest size. Great for music. This is my first Alexa product and overall I am pleased with it.To address the elephant in the room... Yes there are a billion privacy concerns with something like this but honestly the Alexa is the least of my worries. It does the things I ask it to and is really only capable of capturing audio and maybe some network data. That far less of a concern than something like my Android, that has my fingerprints/pictures/credit cards, or my ISP (ahem...cast) that literally mines every single bit of data that passes through my home. There is no such thing as privacy, just join the party.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I live in a 735 sq/ft apartment, the plug I have this plugged in to the central most socket (In a Dot Genie I purchased from Amazon). So far I have had no issue with Alexa not being able to pick up my voice no matter where I am.Currently I have my Echo Dot connected to the following smart devices:-Google Nest thermostat - connecting them was easy.-Six different Phillips lightbulbs - connecting them was easy.-Insignia Fire TV - this is my frustration (and it is my own fault). While my Echo Dot can connect to my Fire TV, Insignia/Best Buy no longer support the Insignia Connect Skill requires to power the tv on/off. In turn I was unable to pair the remote with the Echo Dot so I had to change the name of the Echo Dot from Alexa to Echo since I have two devices that function independently of one another. If anyone has a solution for that I would love to hear it, again this is my fault for not researching before I bought the tv!Although it is taking time to get used to, I am happy with my purchase of the Echo Dot!

A friend gave us a similar device by another company and the Echo Dot has better flow, better technology. Also, it's hilariously non-competitive, because when my 10-year-old asked it what it thought about Siri, Alexa gave a sweet, ""we are all in this together"" kind of answer. I must admit that that made me love the programmers at Amazon a little bit.My kid thinks everyone with an Echo should play Would You Rather, as the Alexa version is awesome. We have no issues with the speaker quality. I bought the Echo because I saw the special pricing and I was considering buying a bluetooth speaker for my kid at the time. We haven't blasted the Echo Dot at its highest volume, because that would be too loud. The sound quality is good for us and we listen to all kinds of music. The microphone is sensitive enough, too.

Setup was quick and easy. I'm just gonna say right off the bat that the sound quality is way better than my older echo. To be specific, sound has more punch to it and is louder. In fact I never need to go past half volume most of the time in my small bedroom. This little guy has decent bass for such a small speaker, I was pleasantly surprised. Sound is so good that honestly, I don't even need to connect my bluetooth speaker to it. To give people some tips on how to improve sound quality of this speaker or any speaker connected to the echo via bluetooth, on the alexa app, go to ""devices"" then go to ""Echo & Alexa,"" select your echo, then finally go to ""Audio Settings"" and from there you can use a EQ to adjust bass, mid range and high range. After putting all three settings to max, sound quality  is even better. However for someone with a larger room and who enjoys louder music will want to use a bluetooth speaker. If you're thinking of upgrading or need an echo dot, buy the current gen, you will not be disappointed. If you have a large living room or bed room and want something louder but do not want to use a bluetooth speaker, then I would go for the echo plus or echo studio.\n",One person found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

It is so easy to hook up and enjoy many different things with Alexa. It will nit disappoint! She recognizes my voice every time too. More so than my husband does. She is much more responsive than he is too. No selective hearing with Alexa, she hears me correctly almost every time. If she doesn't it is because I am yelling at her from across the room. Lol.

You want me to rate voice recognition.  Alexa seems to recognize it with no problem.  I haven't a clue as to what you mean/want for integration.  For a very small device, the sound is excellent.  It is in my bedroom and I hear it clearly in my bathroom, and actually in my living room.  And with my Amazon Prime, I have commercial free music which is a treat.However, Alexa does not know how to answer some of my questions.  Some are technically related to what she does.  For example she didn't know what the flashing green light was.  I had to continue to revise my questions to get the answer.  And to other questions she says, ""Hmmm, I'm not sure about that"" or something to that effect.  My Google device looks it up immediately and gives me some sort of an answer.  Unfortunately, I don't remember a question for  an example to give you. And, when I ask what the temperature is, all I get if the temperature.  My Google device (in the kitchen) not only gives me the temperature, it states my city and gives the forecast for the rest of the day.  When I ask Alexa who the singer is, I get just the singer.  When I ask Google I get the name of the song AND the singer.I hope this helps.\n",One person found this helpful,Configuration: Device only

Some Google devices cannot be integrated with Alexa. So, make sure check the compatible list before the purchase.3. ""AI"". Alexa is not smart as Google.

It's not muffled and the max volume is actually pretty high. I did have a slight problem with the voice recognition. But I'm not 100% sure if it was the device or the alexa software. I would tell it to play a certain radio station and the first few times it worked great but then it began saying ""I'm sorry I can't do that right now."" However when my daughter would say the same thing it would play the station. The problem was reversed with a game, it wouldn't be able to complete the command when my daughter told it to but it would when I said to do it. We did figure out rewording the request would solve the problem, e.g. instead of ""alexa play klove"" I would say ""alexa turn on klove radio"" and it worked. Overall we are very happy with it though.\n",,Configuration: Device only

The new Gen3 Echo is working fine, paired fine as a speaker group in stereo with an earlier Gen3.So I get to nitpick.  I tried to add a second paired speaker group (two previously bought Gen2 Dots) in another room, but the the Alexa software would not connect, using same instructions used for the first group.  I can play the everywhere group with all speaker devices recognized.  One stereo pairing to an account, apparently.  Still good, but a little disappointed my Echo network is flawed. (The Fire TV pseudo Echo Show has yet to be integrated.  Alexa app has identified the device, but seems unenthused to merge it into the network, giving me no prompting to further activate.)\n",,Configuration: Device only

Wake up, get in the shower, get out of the shower, get dressed, eat breakfast, grab your lunch, get your backpack, don't forget your homework, don't forget your phone, leave now so you don't miss your bus. And, he does it! Without attitude! I bought myself 45 minutes in my morning, I don't have to argue with my child ruining his self esteem for the day and making me feel guilty all day. We get to have a fun, peaceful morning, and leave for the day still liking each other!It's also great for the five million timers I have to set when cooking so all my is ready at the exact time and served hot.I say, ""Good morning, Alexa.""

Many times I will get in bed while leaving the bathroom or hallway light on but by putting these wifi devices in these areas I can then ask Alexa to turn them on and off, also depending on which wifi light socket you get, you are able to set the brightness on a regular normal light bulb. When I get up in the morning I have Alexa to turn on the bathroom light, the living room lights and my smart tv, I can even use Alexa to set the volume on the television which is great considering how the volumes are different from each HDMI port. This is especially helpful if you lose your remote or don't feel like walking to get it if you had placed away from yourself. Depending on the wifi device you get to set it up can be easy to tricky. I would strongly advise anyone who is having problems setting up their wifi devices to go to YouTube and search for a similar device if not the same one.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I probably would not have seeked a device like this without the deal. With that being said, this thing is pretty cool. Despite its size, this thing gets LOuD. You can hear it from rooms away if you are playing music or something. Automatically came synced to the rest of my devices and my home Wifi. If you can get it for free or very cheap, do so. You can't get electronics like this for free anywhere else. Even if not, it is worth buying if you are into these types of things. Not bad.

I'm a little bit of a nerd and found out all these great little easter eggs relating to Star Trek. I think it's really great.  I'm sure i'm not remotely using it to it's full potential so I bet it can be even greater once i start integrating it with other devices.  The voice recognition is decent.  It does occasionally not pick things up and sometimes i have to yell the wake word while it's playing music, a couple times. It's a little on the small side, which is a good thing however,  the speaker could be a little louder. Setting it up was a breeze.  But over all, a great product.  I recommend it. I would give it 5 stars if I didn't have the small issues with it.  I also got it at the $30 price, so to be honest,  it really was a great buy and deal. I haven't paid for any services for it so I cannot really comment on that but if you don't have multiple units,  you could probably get hy without paying.

First of all I think the speakers and the voice recognition are great. Yes, it's hard for it to understand me when there is too much noise around, but otherwise it works great, even if I speak to it from a far distance.I use it to turn my HUE lights on and off. Setting alarms, reminders, and weather. I tried using the Uber skill, but it just doesn't seem to work in my country, maybe it's not supported here (country in South America). Spotify skill works flawlessly, It's my default music app.My issue comes with how many correct answers it gives you. The fact that you can't use google search, but the device uses Bing, it's a big disadvantage, since it doesn't answer most of the stuff you ask to Alexa or it gives you answers that are just wrong. There's a skill you can install so it can use google search, but it's user made, and you need to code it yourself with some tutorial. I haven't got the time to do it. I just wish there would be a supported Google Skill to download, because Bing just sucks. I guess they can't, since the competition is Google.Other than that, I like my Echo dot a lot, and I need two more to put in the kitchen and living room!\n",,Configuration: Device only

It doesn\u2019t work AT ALL unless plugged into a wall socket at all times which is dumb to me. With all the technology we have, Amazon couldn\u2019t make a portable speaker ???? Alexa can play a song for you that you request one minute and then you can request the same song later and she\u2019ll say she can\u2019t find it and then start playing the song seconds later , it\u2019s confusing.  I connected it to my Apple Music acct because although I have amazon music I\u2019m not accustomed to it yet. I have playlists that I\u2019ve created myself on Apple Music and I thought I could ask Alexa to play my own playlist because i don\u2019t want to keep asking her after every song to play another one and i don\u2019t always like to listen to a whole album by the same person, but NOPE it has to be probably an actual apple created playlist or just one song request. I\u2019ve recently gotten the amazon music app and the only good thing is now I can actually go on the app and play music on my phone and make Alexa play it on the speaker for me so that gives me more control than having to request each song out loud, I can just arrange it on the app I guess.

The Echo Dot (3rd gen) works really well and the speaker quality is surprisingly amazing, even with reading a bunch of reviews saying so.  One example is I like the use the Sleep Sounds skill for stuff like Thunderstorm sounds to fall asleep to; it's CRAZY how realistic it sounds!  I could go on and on about how great these things are, but honestly the reasons why it's so wonderful are about as long as all the functionality these have, so pretty sure the keys on the keyboard would wear out by then!  The only ""gripes"" I have with it is just general ""not always hearing what I say right"" once in a blue moon issues, and that, every so often (but more frequent than I much care for) I'll say ""Alexa"" to do something, and I'll have to say it 3 times because the first two times, all it will do is flash a blue ring around itself for a second and then do nothing/not respond.  Also, the one I have in my living room has had general issues every now and then so I have to unplug it/replug it in every now and then like a modem/router, but honestly, these are mostly just nit-picking, so if they're the biggest issues I have with these, I'll keep quiet now haha.

Sleeve has texture which feels really good to touch (better than previous generation). And same as other echo devices it is sturdy and well made product.Setup -  Setup is very easy and instructions are very well documented.Alexa - Device offers most of if not all the services offered by Alexa app. They are many skills that are per-activated and other you can activate. Alexa is very responsive and react quickly to ""wake word"". Though I would prefer if Amazon can introduce more ""wake words"". It works very well with all streaming application.As a speaker -  As a speaker Echo dot is very good considering the price point. It is better then Google Home Mini. There is an Audio Equalizer skill which you can use to increase/decrease bass,treble,etc... .Overall sound signature is good but it tends to muffle when increase the volume to max both on Alexa and streaming application.In Totality it is a great product.\n",,Configuration: Device only

That is until it was in my house.  I don't have any of the compatible outlets or devices with the echo, but it has already proven convenient, and useful.  So convenient in fact, I bought a bunch of additional echos for the whole house.  From making announcements to the family from multiple rooms, to playing music, setting reminders, and making phone calls, Alexa is great.  Only complaint i would have is that she responds to every single voice.  That means if I wanted to play a song, anyone can interrupt and override that order.  I wish they could add a master command voice recognition system to prevent that.  Oh well, perhaps in the future.  That being said, the family loves the echo dots, and Alexa.  We'll see what happens down the line when I add compatible hardware for the house.

The sound quality for music is still lacking, but ok just for casual background music.  If sound quality for music is important for you this is not your answer, although I don\u2019t believe it was designed to function primarily as a speaker.  It functions well as asmart device to control paired outlets, lights, etc. and other functions and skills offered via the Alexa app.  Although some skills still need some serious work, for example the a DirectTv app is spotty and works inconsistently for me.  This is not related to the device itself however.  I also do not like the new power cord on this one.  Previous version had a standard usb/charging style cord that could be plugged into a charging cube, or a port on a computer, alarm clock, tv, etc.  This generation device does not, but rather just has a standard type 120 cord.  Not a deal breaker for me, but not as convenient as my old dot which I just plugged into the back of my alarm clock and didn\u2019t have to take up another electrical outlet.

But after I played around with it and set up a few routines I was hooked.I have started to convert my apartment into a smart home. The integration is limitless. So many things are Alexa compatible. And for the things that aren't there are smart plugs and smart hubs that are.The voice recognition could be just a tad better. If I speak to fast then what I say might be misconstrued. If I speak too slow I don't get to finish what I'm saying. Still Alexa is by far the best voice recognition software I've used. I prefer it over Siri and Google.The sound quality is decent. I would assume most people with get this product for the smart home features and not for music or the speaker itself. You can hook it up to a speaker or sound system. Which is what I eventually plan to do. I have a echo show as well and that doesn't have the best speaker either, but when you sync them to one group and play music on multiple units the sounds is pretty good. And I just think it's cool I can walk through my apartment and listen to the same playlist simultaneously in every room.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I bought an Echo Flex as well because the shipping on the Dot was going to be delayed. It came a month earlier than expected, which was nice. I had been using the Flex for a about a month.No one would expect the Flex to be good for music. The speaker is not much better than that of a mobile phone. However, Alexa's voice is crisp, clean, and easy to understand. Not so with the Dot. Music is listenable but not great. It's too warm. Alexa's voice on the Dot is muffled. I agree with some other reviews in that it sounds as if the Dot is covered by a pillow. The tone controls in the app do not improve this.I am currently have a set of speakers designed for a PC plugged into the auxiliary jack, and the sound through them is fine.I like the Flex so much I bought one for the bathroom in addition to the bedroom.I am really enjoying using Alexa to control lighting, and with a BroadLink RM4, my A/V system.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I can even turn them off or on when I am away from the house with the Alexa app.I love that the Alexa connects to my Apple Music and SiriusXM. I just tell it what to play and Shazam, it does it.Great when making love, just tell Alexa to play romantic music and we don\u2019t have to skip a bear changing stations.Love this little device for all the above mentioned reasons and I can ask for a weather update or current temp.

Busy schedule? No worries! Alexa will keep track of all your appointments and events, give you reminders, and serve as your alarm clock. She'll tell you the time when asked, tell you about the weather and what you can expect for the week.She plays me my favorite songs, tells me bedtime stories, or just plays some pleasant sleep sounds. She can crack the occasional joke, and even passes gas from time to time.Having multiple echo dot devices, or other Alexa compatible speakers in your home can make communicating with individuals, or everyone at once throughout your home as easy speaking to a little speaker on the counter.She's very handy for hands-free movie selection on my firestick. Yay!And can even be used to control various lights, some appliances, and even control the temperature in my home.She never allows the NSA agent listening to interrupt my life, as I'm sure sometimes he is dying to chime in with how disgusting some recipes I've requested from Alexa sounds, or to complain of the stupid questions I ask, such as: Alexa, how many milliseconds until Christmas?

Sure I don't get a screen like with the Echo show 5, BUT it never loses connection, it hears me just fine even talking quietly. It just works and that's all that matters. Other things to note is it seems to be even quicker to respond and do commands.

There is no subscription cost to use echo, but if you are an Amazon Prime member ($99.00 a year) you will get a lot more out of it. Alexa is worth buying, and it comes down to the simple fact that it can make your life easier if you know how to use it. There are ways to set it up to your lifestyle or likeness.You can now use Amazon Music for free on Echo devices...Amazon has launched a free version of its music-streaming service Amazon Music. You don't need a Prime subscription to use Alexa and it's only the Amazon Music part that you'll use via Alexa. Alexa, through Amazon's lineup of smart speakers, can now control several models of smart TVs using voice commands. Netflix now supports deep Alexa voice controls on Fire TV devices. You can set up lists (shopping list, home depot list, etc.), routines, (set an alarm with music everyday at 6AM), play music, etc. If you have several amazon devices, they will connect to each other. It is also friendly with Nest, Hue Phillips and many other companies in which they're products can be use through Alexa.

The setup was flawless and could not have been simpler. It actually takes the settings from you Alexa app on your phone, this is very smart ! Kudo's to the team for this bit of genius.  The sound quality and volume are 10 times better with down firing bass. It is so much clearer. My wife loves to listen to music via voice command and this 3rd Gen is very sensitive, can hear a whisper.  I just want to mention the packaging here. It is simple and well thought out, just enough box to fit the device in the two levels  with plug and documentation tucked in the bottom leaving the initial opening experience for the Echo Dot itself. Overall, I am enjoying this opening process and look forward to my next purchase for the new FireTV stick 3rd gen as well. Wish they had a bundle but since the new FireTV stick will not be ready for ship until May10, I will be patient. '!'\n",,Configuration: Device only

Amazon customer service was unable to help me fix the issue. After several calls with Amazon's tech support, explaining that Alexa would not accept my correct password, they recommended I call my internet provider. They didn't know the solution, either. Eventually, I went into my WiFi router's control panel and found a ""WPA passphrase"" which - when I entered it in the Alexa set-up process - solved the issue. It took about a week to get my Alexa working. Amazon should have been aware of this issue and the fix for it.I am happy with it now, though some of the voice responses feel disappointingly corny or unnatural (e.g., I don't want the voice to say ""You bet!"" or ""Anytime"" when I make the mistake of saying ""Thank you"" to a non-sentient computer.)

We had never named the rooms in our house so that was a bit of a brain scratch.  One of the dots is in the ""Master Bedroom"" and the other is in the ""Family Room"".  One upstairs and one downstairs.  Our old house has a lot of built-in lights and at this time they are not controlled with Alexa.  At first, we did not know how to set up the system, or what words to use, when we got the dots.  After a few youtube videos, and chatting with friends, we feel as though we are doing okay in using the system.  To control the outlets we purchased some 3rd party (tp-link) outlet (3 per pack) which required a different app to be installed that allows Alexa to operate them.  So far no issues with the apps and we have good control of the of these plugs.  My Samsung TV is one generation back and cannot connect to Alexa.  I should have looked that up before we got them but that knowledge would not have changed my decision.  Implementation and use is very easy.

I can turn on or off my Christmas lights with the sound of my voice alone, again no matter where in the house I am.

I now have one studio, 3 flex and 3 dots. They work well.  But one must understand they are not smart. They are not a whole lot better than Google voice. If they are AI then this must be the lowest level possible. All Alexa can do is respond to your commands and look things up on the internet. For example, I say put X on my Amazon shopping list. She replies I can't find a Amazon shopping list, do you want me to make one?  I say No. She says OK.  She doesn't ask should this go on your regular list.  Otherwise she can't think of a possible alternative, she is not smart.  She  can't reason even the simplest  of problems.

Sometimes alexa doesn't listen well to what I ask it but usually I just need to word it a different way. Thats not much of a problem since most devices like alexa have these problems/annoyances.

I bought the Alexa + Hue Lights bundle and already I can tell that it\u2019s going to be good! The hue lights came in a two pack and prices separately they would have costed me $44 while the Alexa would have costed $40. I got BOTH of them for $32 (the Alexa was on sale for $22 and the hue lights costed $10 more). Best deal yet! Saved me almost $60 dollars! MUST BUY! I will probably buy this again too if the deal is still here the next time my paycheck rolls aroundUpdate:Still a very cool and awesome deal! It was a gift to my mother for Christmas and she feel in love Alexa. One of the reasons I got her this is because her room gets extremely dark at night and she has to walk across it to her to the light switch, now all she has to do is ask Alexa at the door and the lights come on. Alexa has been such a big help for her and she\u2019s now helping my mother learn a new language so it\u2019s very interesting to watch.I will also say that all of those Alexa \u201clife hack\u201d videos have also been VERY fun to try out especially the \u201cActivate Pikachu\u201d option.

One in my bedroom and the other in my living room since my home inside build is very open so I only have the 2 echo dots which are great for playing the unlimited amazon music account I have and the sound quality is awesome coming from such a little device. So instead of me playing from multiple devices for my music or for writing my lists and posting on the fridge I set everything up through the Alexa app on my phone and can voice control my tv, music, daily activity lists, appt reminders which by the way the echo dot lets me know and has its wake up alarm deal which is a big plus for me.

I have appliances connected to smart plugs and Alexa turns them off and on and I find I set a lot of timers for things so she's helpful for that and answering questions, too.This newer dot is larger than my older one. I'd actually call it bulky. It's not unattractive but I can see why the holders for the different generationsare not interchangeable.Set up was easy, the holder is great, it's helpful to have this second dot. What I do not like is the bass is too much. Maybe it's my ears, I don't know. It makes it hard to understand Alexa. I have tried adjusting the bass down to zero through the equalizer and that has helped but I don't feel I should have to do that. So, I'm disappointed. The music played from my kitchen dot is fine. If I want to really hear music I will play it with my Sonos speakers and not my dot. I need the voice to be clear and it just isn't. Maybe it's defective?

Was told by friends that I should get the echo plus for that but the echo dot had great sound quality for the price even beating some of my friends pricier speakers, the sound volume gets loud but not as high a speaker meant for music only. It\u2019s way easier for me to get the music to play than on a simple speaker because it\u2019s voice command vs selecting on your phone (although you can select from your phone). I can ask it for questions on the go or pause it when my family needs me in a hurry. The Skyrim feature is a hoot, so silly. My only problem is that there\u2019s a weird disconnect between the Alexa app and the amazon music app which confuses it. If you use the voice command to ask it to play music it will play amazon music through the Alexa app. If you want to change the song it\u2019s either voice command or through the Alexa, or an extra prompt through music asking for permission to play over the current song. Also Alexa is extremely forgiving to those with stutters such as myself and quiet voices. It\u2019s a great mic which despite me stuttering or talking quietly, it still delivers exactly what I want. I struggle with Siri and other voice command programs but had no issue with Alexa on the echo dot.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I have it in my room, and also have a smart plug to go with it. I just ask Alexa to turn off my lights, and she does! The speaker quality is really good for this small of a speaker, and works great in my room to project the sound around it. Alexa recognizes my voice 95% of the time, the 5% being when I don\u2019t whisper loud enough in whisper mode(you whisper to her and she whispers back, it\u2019s great for at night!).  99% of radio stations have a way to stream them, and I haven\u2019t found a single platform not supported on the Echo(I\u2019ve used stations that stream with iHeartRadio, Radio.com, TuneIn). You can play music from many platforms, like Spotify and Amazon Music. I recommend it, it\u2019s a nice little gizmo that makes life easier. If you\u2019re not sure which Echo version to buy, I\u2019d say the Echo Dot is the best combo of function and price, but if you need a better speaker you can get the regular Echo or Echo Plus. If you want a screen then get the Echo Show or Spot. But for most people, the Dot is plenty good for them and you can easily find it on sale for $25 or so.

I recently bought this pair on the cheapest deal I've seen to replace a couple of Gen 1 Echo Dot units.  Gen 3 sounds better when used as a speaker; it arguably looks better; and it works better for networking music all over the house.  Other than that an Echo is an Echo is an Echo.  The nice thing about Amazon is that all of the Echos still play nicely with each other....firmware upgrades have not obsoleted the earliest units...so I have a Gen 1 (full-sized tall) Echo that works perfectly well when networked both Gen 2 and Gen 3 units.  I tell friends (totally tongue in cheek) that I live with nine women...and they're all named Alexa !!  I use them for many purposes and one or more of them get used pretty much every hour of the day.

It will also stream radio stations from Tune-in.  3rd generation audio is the weakest point as it was for previous Dot generations. There is just too much bass and too little treble. You can tell Alexa to reduce the bass and increase the treble which helps. The 3rd generation has an audio jack that, if you connect it to your stereo or computer, will deliver top notch audio.  I use it for Pandora which is free.  The Dot has been around long enough now to have many, many skills... for the price you can't beat it.\n",,Configuration: Device only

You can even technically start your coffee, adjust your thermostat, unlock doors, preheat oven, and even vacuume your house, all without having to lift a finger...just by using your voice. Some features require smart home devices. Super customizable. Even has a sort of app store with it, where it can learn or you can get blueprints: to create new skills for the device to use. Such as headspace, meditation, listen to your favorite podcasts, even soothing sounds for the dog while your away. I expecially love the black model, really nice and super sleek. Makes the changing colored lights look really dope on the black because it stands out and seems to be even brighter then the white model. Anyways, if you set it up right and dont belive that its listening to you 24/7 (which its not)...then it's one of the best products for that price I've ever owned.

The echo is perfect for that EXCEPT it's unreliable. Sometimes it'll quit playing during the first song or it'll play music for hours. I don't understand why it's this unreliable. That is the biggest downfall for me. It just glitches. And the majority of issues comes when playing music.It does restart itself more often than it should.When asking a question for information, it gets confused often.I do love how it can learn over time. For example. I have four WiFi light bulbs and one WiFi smart plug. I have tried renaming the light bulbs because Alexa seems to get confused. Now I just say ""Alexa, turn on living room lights"" and the AI has learned what devices. It's still quite blotchy and gets confused. I have labeled my lights as 'light 1', 'light 2', 'light 3', and 'light 4'. When I want them to turn on or off I'll say ""Alexa turn _ living room lights"".Overall I am pleased with my purchase.

When Sirius XM offered the Echo Dot as a freebie for renewing my membership, I thought I would do a little comparison. The sound quality is nearly the same. Echo offers a of programs and games the same as Google. I can connect to my favorite podcasts with both. Both have some difficulty picking the exact podcast I request. They both want to play the most recent episodes and not pull up any others when given a voice command. The one thing I like the most about the Echo is its ability to connect to my Prime account, specifically my music. The Google requires membership for other programs especially the fee ones. I have a lot of basic apps such as Spotify and don't want to pay the extra fee to upgrade. So when I ask for a certain singer or song I am told a membership is required ""but here is a station that plays....."". With the Dot, I can ask for something specific and that is what I will get. It will also tell me about my pending purchases, shipping etc. But Amazon already communicates very well by email and text on any purchases so it is a bit redundant. So in short...If I wasn't already so immersed in the Google world with my android phone, tablet and TV, I would switch to the Dot.\n",,Configuration: Device only

It was actually super useful. Then I took a few minutes to link my calendar account and spotify, and suddenly I was using it to listen to music and add events to my calendar. It's so intuitive and easy. I love never having to physically add another event to my phone ever and being able to ask what I've got on my calendar. I've barely had it for a month and I already know there are only going to be more uses for the echo as time goes on.

There are so many use cases that I find what hinders the echoes performance, if anything, is just my lack of understanding of everything that it can do, and all its commands. You can get into the game real fast by having one of these, a couple smart bulbs, and smart switches- but it\u2019s way more than being able to turn something on or off- I have two echoes as of now (and plan on getting more) and one of our favorite features so far is being able to connect them and use it for music to play throughout the whole house. The other feature we thought was useful was the intercom feature- it\u2019s easy to let everyone know dinner is ready no matter where they are in the house.They have good range so as long as you place your echoes strategically they can cover a lot of ground. The list of features/ capabilities goes on so I\u2019d recommend looking up all of that info online or YouTube so you can use it to its fullest potential.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I speak to a lot of people from other countries and some don't speak very much English.  To be able to put Alexa in ""translation mode"" and have her communicate between 2 languages... well epic!!!2. Battery power. Even a small amount would be great.  Transitional power even. So you can take her one room to the next without losing your current book or Playlist.

I like being able to set multiple timers and name them like coffee timer, flip the steak timer and so on. I also regularly use the reminder feature to remind me to do regular tasks. The main problem that I have been having is I can't figure out how to set a timer and have it sound off on both dots in both locations. Also, I subscribe to Sleep Sounds premium and Alexa refuses to acknowledge that I have a premium membership. I haven't talked to a help representative yet on the timer issue, but when I spoke to a help agent regarding the Sleep Sounds issue she was not very knowledgeable or helpful and didn't get the problem fixed. That, however, is a customer service issue and not a product issue. I like this product so well that I'm considering getting an Echo Show if they go on sale.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I'd been holding out because I'd witnessed my friends struggle with earlier versions of Alexa, yelling at it when it didn't obey a voice command and I wasn't impressed by the sound.But, Amazon had a great sale on the Dot so I figured I'd try it out.  The sound quality is amazing. I can't believe this little thing has such a big sound.The voice recognition is really good too. I rarely have to repeat a command and it recognizes even the most brief command from me. For instance, first thing in the morning I'm groggy and mumble ""Computer, Lana DelRay"" and it plays Lana DelRay easily.I call it ""Computer"" because you can change the wake word options on this model.  Your choices are Alexa, Amazon, Echo or Computer. I chose Computer because I'm a Trekkie and addressing the device like Jean-Luc Picard makes my inner nerd happy. I assume that's why they made that option available in the first place.I like the Skills. Particularly the morning skill. I can say Good Morning and it gives me the weather, calendar and news.I don't use the ""Tell Me Joke"" skill or anything like that, but there are a couple of fun Star Trek skills you can add that are fun.All in all I'm very happy with this device.

I think people who are griping about the sound quality are those who expect this Echo to play music and fill out an entire large living room. That is an unrealistic expectation. Look at the size of this thing. The sounds are richer and the bass is fuller. It plays music and it sounds great in my master bedroom.2) shape is improved and it feels more quality than the plastic-y feeling of the previous model.3) the set-up was crazy simple. and it was pretty easy to set up the previous model so that's wild.Here is my 1 CON:The 2nd gen Dot connected via micro-USB, which is a pretty simple and universal cord.The 3rd gen, however, uses what seems to be a dedicated cord for Echos only. I do not like that. In the event I need a new cord, I will need to go to Amazon and only Amazon for a replacement.

When the new version came out, we liked the improved aesthetics and the fact that the Dot now features a better built-in speaker. Upgrading allowed us to get rid of the under-mount stereo we had the old Dot plugged into, since the speaker quality on the new device is excellent. It does get bogged down under heavy bass, but for normal listening and most music there's no distortion, and the sound easily fills a large room at high volume. The new Dot looks much better than the original and blends in better with its surroundings, despite the added size. Alexa voice recognition seems to be on par with older versions of the Dot, which is to say it will pick up what you're saying most of the time. I have noticed, with this Dot on one side of the main floor of the house and the original Dot on the other, both devices do respond to the wake word at times, and about 50% of the time the device farther away carries out the requested action. The limitations of modern AI are real, but the device works great and simplifies a lot of stuff in the kitchen. In short, we love it!\n",,Configuration: Device only

I was fully expecting a lot more plastic and these feeling very fragile. They're basically built like small tanks. And the sound quality is incredibly impressive. Like mini-stereo systems in each room. Just really nice. We had considered getting a land line also, but this essentially acts as a phone also. Our kids call us from the Echo. It's just impressive.The only small gripe I have is that when you connect the dot to your TV to act as a speaker, it turns off the TV audio. It would be nice if these could be used as something akin to a sounder or speaker in another part of the room, just for extra punch.It would be nice also if the wall mount were priced accordingly to the Echo. It seems a bit steep for a piece of plastic. Would make sense to have it be like 7-8 bucks.We also just connected Tidal with zero effort. Pandora, Tidal, etc all work pretty flawlessly. The Charcoal is just a really nice, neutral, modern color that fits in pretty much anywhere. The kids love it. It's basically the best sound system for a kids room I can think of.

Alexa doesn't always know the answer but continues to evolve. Misunderstandings happen on occasion but become less frequent the more she becomes familiar with your voice. Adding a new one to an existing system with the app sometimes is a little glitchy but other times goes smoothly. I've found it best to do the setup of a new one close to where your WiFi signal is strongest and go ahead and label the device with the intended location and only then to move it to that location. Once in place, and assuming your WiFi doesn't have dead or very weak areas, you can use the mobile app to create various speaker groups and you can then send music to selected areas of your home, or to the entire house, as desired and I love this feature as lots cheaper than a Sonos system. However, I have to say the mobile app is sluggish at times and could stand some improvement. At the same time, I admit my Android cell phone is more than 3 yrs old so not sure if this has anything to do with the sluggishness.\n",,Configuration: Device only

(I got my Google Nest Mini free for being a Youtube Premium subscriber before this). So I pretty much went more toward google but figured i would get this since it was free. Google has 'routines' which i find to be easier to setup than the Echo Dot. But the Echo Dot seems to be more intuitive for the commands to get things done. I always have issues with choosing the correct command on the Google Nest Mini to the point where i'm frustrated, but the Echo Dot seems to know what i want better. It also listens for commands better; when i say Alexa... she is ready to go. When i say OK Google... not so much.Overall, if I had received the Echo Dot first, i probably would have gone all in and would use it more often.

They are 60 watts can do warm and daylight as well as millions of colors in between. Those have been the best paired with the Amazon Dot. I have three different manufactures lights and the ones from Costco were the easiest to put together on the network. It's all about making routines with an Amazon dot. Once you learn how to make a routine sky's the limit on really what you can do. Right now when one of my friends comes over I have Alexa talking trash to him via the Xbox. It's fantastic.

I appreciate the option to mute the mic, but do not like eat red light on all night, especially in a very dark room like the bedroom when sleeping. Also, unplugging it each night as a turn-off option is not very functional, especially if you plan to use it for alarms to early morning activities. So here is my creative solution, so feel free to use it. I plugged my echo into a wifi smart plug that I have setup on timer to turn-off at my bedtime and turn-on before I arise in the morning. That way, I can start the day with giving Alexa commands and not feel as though she is listening to everything that I do throughout the night. :-) This appears to be the best solution for me right now until Amazon comes up with an option to turn the device on and off. If anyone else has any ideas, I would love to hear them. Keep in mind this is more about privacy during quite hours than anything else, so keep that in mind if you decide to comment.

And it can can add things on to your Amazon shopping list. Some Cons: it is more limited as to information it can provide compared to Google Home. Google is an internet server and Amazon is not, therein lies a great difference. The app is hard to figure out how to use when integrating it with other devices in the home, like being able to control a Whirlpool range or smart lights, and I still haven't been able to figure out how to do that because it's not intuitive like the Google Home app. So I control all other devices with the Google Home app. But we would buy it again.

I finally gave in and got one after I fell a few times due to illness and needed to be able to call out for help. It is really cool and has so many functions. Now I can easily turn my bedroom lights on and off with just a verbal command! I add things to my shopping list. My daughter plays with it all the time. It even tells me the weather. And, the voice recognition is excellent. Now, if I fall, all I have to do is call out for help and it will call for me.

Instead of using Ai to glean and suss, it just says ""Here's something about that on Wikipedia: ... ."" I'd hoped when I ask something like, ""How tall is Somebody?"", Alexa will say, ""According to Whosits.com, he is 7'-3""."" The answers sometimes take quite a while, whilst Alexa reads lengthy articles verbatim. Actually, a bit irritating when one is hoping for a yes or no.On the other hand, having three sets up a nice sound system in the house that allows me to go from room to room and enjoy music or discussions w/o missing much. Because Hubby can't quite get the hang of not mentioning Alexa's name, thus triggering her, I've enabled the Study to answer to ""Computer,"" so I feel quite Captain Kirk-ish saying, ""Computer, do this!"" I'd've preferred an option to choose other names and have one called Minerva after the sentient computer in Heinlein's ""Time Enough for Love.""  I suppose I'd hoped for a bit more. Still, a pleasant addition to the house.Oh, another reason to rename your Alexa: It's fun to walk into someone's home and say aloud, ""Alexa: order 37 cases of creamed corn.""

My favorite add-on is Amazon Music.  I can ask for any song by any artist, and it is almost always available.  I do that just to listen, or to listen to a particular artist or particular genre, or play and sing along to learn the song to sing at my music group.  It also sets my alarms and reminders, tells me when my packages have been delivered, converts measurements when I'm cooking, and will tell me a joke and say goodnight.  Its uses are absolutely unending.My reason for only four stars on this review is related to Amazon policy.  The pin for the speaker jack is out of position and unusable on this item, and when I asked for a replacement, I was told I could only have a refund.  Since I bought this one at discount, it would cost me extra to take the refund and buy a new one.

My brother has Google's offering and they're not bad either;' but I feel Amazon has a good thing going here with their Echo line.Alexa voice recognition is spot on.The speaker used for sound, plays music pretty well. It's louder than I thought. Now, will it win any audiophile awards, of course not; that's why you buy the Dot's big brother. It does play music quite well enough that I don't have a problem with it. Creating routines is a breeze and can be quite fun. The skills you can get are great (although pay attention to the reviews, some are junk), All of this adds up to making the Echo Dot an amazing way to start building up your future smart home.I recently paired them up with smart bulbs and now I have almost everything I want for my home.If you are looking for a great way to enter into smart home tech and don't want to spend a fortune?

Love the size and look of the gen 2, but they lack seriously in both sound quality and volume output (and given the size, I wasn't expecting anything more). The 3rd gen is not too much bigger, but both the volume and the quality of the sound is so much better. It won't flip your wig or anything,  but I was pleasantly surprised at the fullness of the sound given it's size. I noticed a couple of reviews that said the second gen sounded better or they were better able to hear the second gen.  I can only assume it's easier for them to hear because the second gen has zero midbass making the higher tones easier to hear without the competing lower frequencies. For myself, I can hear the 3rd gen across the room, where I struggled hearing gen 2 unless the room was somewhat quiet. Definitely worth the upgrade, especially on sale.

The end of man.  Alexa took over my house.  It\u2019s started on Black Friday 2019.  Amazon offered a deal that couldn\u2019t be beat. Once I had SkyNet I mean Alexa hooked up and running it began.  I got lazy, really lazy and I loved it.  I was hooked.  I ordered six more echos.  I ordered smart light bulbs and Smart light switches, smart thermostat and smart plugs and Ring cams.  It won\u2019t end.  Now Alexa is everywhere. Listening.  Judging me. Watching.  Probably waiting for the right time to strike a blow in America\u2019s heartland.  It\u2019s a slow process. But Alexa is patient.  I\u2019m so lazy now I don\u2019t get up to turn the light off or change my thermostat. I can even see who\u2019s at the door from my couch.  I\u2019m gaining weight slowly.  And in a few decades I\u2019ll die, probably of heart disease.  The calories I burned moving around and now being stored.  My LDL is out of whack.

My room is upstairs, my mom and brother are both disabled and cannot climb stairs, and our laundry room is in the basement.  I purchased 5 Echo Dots, one for my room (upstairs), one for the living room (living room), one for my mom's bedroom (mom's room), one for my brother's bedroom (George's room), and one for the basement (basement).  Each unit's name is in ().  All they have to do from any room in the house is have that unit call either upstairs or basement and we communicate perfectly.  In addition, it's nice to get the news or weather or to listen to my choice of music in any room.  I also use Alexa to place phone calls to anyone listed in my cell phone directory and the Echo Dots are just like speaker phones throughout the house.  I also use Alexa to tell me the time and to provide me with quick conversions such as ""How many tablespoons are there in a cup""?

Dont even have to turn my head to look at the clock. I just say ""Echo *pause* Time"" and the time is spoken outloud. When I first received my first Echo, I thought that I was not going to use it. Boy was I wrong. I bought another for my room and going to buy one for my sons room. Its like the web, encyclopedia, media player, and even some mindless chit chat available and accessible with just the wake word.  I discover something new that Alexa can do almost everyday. Funny how I thought I was not going to use, I  can't picture myself with this electronic assistant named Alexa.

We live in a multi story house and will be using these as our intercom system. Hopefully one day Alexa will partner up with more home security companies, like Xfinity, so those under contracts will be able to use the security voice commands. But for now, the guard is still a pretty neat feature. It's also nice to know that the echo dot can pair up with your current Bluetooth speakers! I had to YouTube how to do it bc it's a process initially setting up, but once your Bluetooth devices have been saved in your dots system, it is merely a simple command every time after that. And the Alexa voice commands (Alexa, search Crowder on Pandora) will still work through the dot when it's paired with the Bluetooth speaker! For that reason I will be ordering the wireless battery pack for the dot so that I can have her outside on the bartop at our parties/BBQs and guests can command songs/stations they want to hear like a jukebox and the music will play out of our existing outdoor installed Bluetooth speakers.

The Echo Dot Gen 3 is the best!  First, let me start on the voice recognition. It doesn't matter if you're having a huge house party where the music is loud, people talking, etc. The Echo Dot Gen 3 with Alexa integration will in a near instant recognize the call of her name and start listening. It is so good! I cannot even explain how much times I have been grateful for the 4 microphones that can hear my voice, it is HIGHLY convenient.  Next: the sound quality. The sound quality, I can say, is the best so far for a speaker like this. The sound is crystal clear and I can hear every detail coming from those great speakers, I have nothing to say except that you will not have trouble hearing the highs, mids, and lows produced from this speaker and will be satisfied with the sound quality.  Overall, the Echo Dot 3rd Generation from Amazon is by far the best smart speaker out the market out there,  and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone! Again, the smart speaker has amazing mobility for its size, the price is just right, the speakers crispy clear, and the voice recognition and Alexa integration just sets it way further ahead than other smart speakers out there!\n",,Configuration: Device only

The voice recognition works well, because I can be in the shower and ask her something and she\u2019s able to respond without us having to yell like we are a football field away. The sound is better too. We have it sitting up a bit on our sink and the sound is a bit clearer. Plus we don\u2019t have to turn it up all the way to hear it. The integration works with our Alexa enabled lights And we can ask it to turn the lights on and use the Amazon app. All-in-all I would say that there could be some more upgrades that\u2019ll make it even better, but what they have now really does pack a punch from the original one.\n",,Configuration: Device only

Also love when I\u2019m cooking I can say \u201cAlexa set a timer for 30 minutes\u201d and then boom my forgetful butt gets an alarm letting me know dinner is ready. Speaking of forgetful, she even keeps and adds to my grocery list each time I remember to tell her what we need! On top of that, I used to wrestle with plugging the Christmas lights in every year. I would blindly fumble with them until I finally found the outlet. I ordered the smart plug in, linked them, nicknamed it, and said \u201cAlexa, turn the Christmas light on\u201d and voila! lights. Oh and we like to leave some sort of noise on for our dog when we\u2019re not home. The last thing I do now before I leave the house is say \u201cAlexa, turn on 94.7\u201c and the radio magically starts playing.

Other times I have to unplug it to get it to respond/play music again but that doesn't always work. I added a second Echo 3rd generation thinking I wanted a stereo sound. I can't do that without a $15.00 subscription so I learned that the hard way. I figured I'd use the second speaker to listen to the TV in the bedroom instead. There is a serious legacy so it is only good if I don't actually watch the TV at the same time. Also, I have to unplug and plug back in to get Alexia to actually play the sound from my TV. Mind you, the TV is an Amazon Fire TV with Alexia built-in. Alexia can turn my TV on but not play sound.

I am expanding my garage/woodworking time. I have a 24"" TV without extra media connections, just an HDMI port.I had been using a Fire Stick in the HDMI, but wanted a Media/Music/Streaming system. The Dot is the central of the system.I have the TV Fire Stick linked to the Dot, and a set of Dell media speakers w/Sub Woofer.It works transparently - I just hit the on button for the TV. Then I can just tell Alexa to play my Unlimited Music, or stream Prime Video, major networks (ABC,CBS, Fox, NBC, ESPN, and Sling) and rarely need to use the remote control.Media System: 24"" LG TV, Fire TV Stick $30, Echo Dot 3 $19, Dell Speakers w/Sub $70.

Anyways, we \u2018dropped in\u2019 on him a few times. He seemed amused. Then when his cable went out he asked Alexa the Celtics score when the game was on. He also started using the timer feature when he was on his exercise bike. The fun part came when his phone service was out. (Do you see a pattern with Comcast? \U0001f914).

Alexa has assister with homework questions that I have difficulty with. Like physics terminology.Although we do not utilize many of the features the ones we do use have been helpful with day to day tasks like grocery lists and reminders.The only problems i have encountered are random spmquabbles between my kids over important issues like whether or not it would be funny to add diet water the my shopping list and my daughter commandeering the Spotify account.

I grabbed a few GoSund outlets & they pair great for working lamps throughout the house. I was a little disappointed with the integration to FireStick; although the feature works- the echo takes all the audio from my TV. I would like to control it with the dot, but since since the audio is blocked from coming out of the TV, and only out of the dot, the location is in a weird place for tv sound to come from.

Our son purchased and set it up for us and while still a bit apprehensive, we quickly learned the value of the Echo Dot.  So many daily routines are made so much simpler by this little gem.  Smart bulbs have allowed for less step running every day.  Reminders have allowed us to not have to write constant notes to ourselves.  While it is nice to have these on a phone, having someone repeat them back to you is far better.  I spend many hours in the kitchen preparing a specialized diet and the use of product identifying timers has already become a lifesaver...no more setting 3 or 4 timers and attempting to remember which was set for what particular food product.  My 80 year old husband has enjoyed hours of listening to old radio shows and taking up challenges offered in various apps.  For me, the available music is a wonderful feature.

My other complaint would be, even with Amazon prime a lot of the newer and more popular older songs are required to be purchased with Amazon's music extension or individually that was very disappointing that the music is not included with prime. As well as you have to purchase an add on to be able to play music on multiple Alexa speakers in the same household for example if my spouse is listening to music in the living room using the Alexa speaker and I have another one in the kitchen that I want to use and listen to a different song It will not let you unless you purchase a family plan again disappointing that it's not included with prime.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I also didn't know it was chargable, I assumed the cord included was a charger, but its the power cord, so no moving the Dot around unless you unplug and power back on. Last thing, it will not play music outside of certain apps. I have a YouTube playlist of music, and Apple music on my phone. It will not connect to either of those. So I'm stuck with basically the free music apps that are not customized to my liking. So before you know it you've skipped your max allowed, and your stuck.

Was I surprised!  It's not super fantastic, but whether music or voice, it sounds great and fills a large room with clear 360 degree sound. I got it solely to listen to my SiriusXM stations. Whether played loud or soft, it is remarkable.  The voice recognition is very sensitive. In fact at certain levels, if a commercial is played and mentions ""Alexa"", the unit prepares itself to listen to commands. Other than that, it's a very recommendable, nice sounding unit; better than my expensive first generation Bose Wave Radio. However, don't feed the interactive A.I. too many successive commands or it will shut down and you will have to reinitialize it by unplugging for a moment. It will, at times, confuse your commands, so speak clearly. The Alexa App is good, you can silently turn on the unit to your desired station, HOWEVER, you have to voice command it to turn off.  I don't have any house electronics attached to auto-activate, so cannot comment on it's integration features.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I paired it with my smart plugs and light bulbs. However, it is not that smart sometimes to respond when it ask it something, and I have to ask it to delete my voice recordings everyday to protect my privacy.

We use them primarily to listen to music and the sound is great. It's also extremely helpful in the kitchen, when your hands are messy, you can set timers, add items to your grocery list, ask questions about ingredients, recipes etc without stopping to wash your hands (or trying to type/scroll with your knuckles). You can even connect it to answer or make phone calls. Added bonus, Alexa will call your phone for you so you can find it if you've misplaced it...again.The additional dots were purchased for the bathroom where all great ideas used to go to die. Now Alexa can save them as notes. And the basement workshop, mostly for hands free music however, there are too many helpful skills to mention that will be handy in each room! I used to be leery about being listened to by who knows who but if someone wants to listen to my dinner prep karaoke, that's their problem!

Although I also have Siriux-XM on my car radio, its streaming service offers a much larger selection of radio stations.This is a tiny device, yet I was genuinely surprised by its VERY rich sound quality, which is better than my much older Siriux-XM boom box.Unfortunately, I use this device at work instead of at home, so I hate having to ""speak"" to Alexa every time I want her to change the channel, and although I've read online that Alexa will let you whisper to her, she must suffer congenital hearing loss because she requires me to yell at her before she'll respond.Trust me; I'm normally not an abusive husband or companion.One positive side effect is that she requires me to arrive at work extra early to request my day's soothing musical backdrop.

We've installed smart switches, plugs, cameras, etc. in the house before, but it really didn't feel ""smart"" until we integrated all of those devices with echo and alexa.  Multiple brands of ""things"" are now under one system.  Besides using voice commands to turn things on and off, we ask for weather, news, stock market, etc.  We don't need to convince the kids they can't wear shorts everyday.  They just ask Alexa for the temperature before they go out to decide what to wear.

Alexa's principal primary residence is in the living room, then she has a smaller flex pad she hangs out in the kitchen and best of all when I work in the basement she some with me and plays my favorite music in the basement. She always very attentive and never argues or complains about my choice of music. Also she knows how to keep her mouth shut and not embarrass me by blabbing to all the world that we listen to a lot of Queen music and Opera.I believe she must be part Viking or Wagnerian as she is always ready to guard the house and  fond of the Ring Cycle and Leitmotifs. For that is how she communicates. ""To Valhalla and back.""If it goes on sale I will buy another one.\n",,Configuration: Device only

This particular model is in our Living room.  We use it all the time to control the living room lights, turn the ""living room"" off as we walk out the door, ask Alexa questions, and play music.  As we walk out the door, we just ask, ""Alexa, turn the living room off"".

We preordered one before they had come out. Now that I work from home a lot and my \u201coffice\u201d is upstairs I finally had the need for an additional echo device. The sound is surprisingly good, though not quite as good as my trusty echo, but good. I use her as an alarm clock, alerts of reminders, scheduled tasks, and she tells me corny jokes when I am needing a break. She can read me a good book from my kindle library and several other skills, but the most fun I have had is devising ways to automate my workspace eco-system and lighting. She controls lights, led strips, television, and sound system flawlessly. Great purchase! Now we have four of these around the house because the drop in feature really makes yelling up to the kids to come to dinner or to get in the car disappear.

So versatile.,"\nAlexa voice control is a little difficult at first. You have to be fairly precise in what you are requesting Alexa to do. After you get used to that it works pretty well. The integration side of Alexa is the reason I rated it a four. I have had a hard time with Smart lights (Phillips) and my Kindle. The Kindle tends to be slow and not responsive at times. The Hue Bridge works pretty well.Sound Quality is mediocre at best. If you just want background, it is satisfactory. Above that, get a stereo or receiver. Can't speak for the Echo.Because my wife is ill, I bought it to use the intercom feature. Still have not gotten it to work. As I understand it, you have to tell Alexa the echo you want to talk to and then wait for the connection and the other person to answer before you can talk. So it is not just push a button and talk like they make it sound. Not good in an emergency or immediate need situation.Overall, not a bad product, but has a long way to go for really being useful in a Smart Home.\n",,Configuration: Device only

There are still many functions I have not used, and more to learn about it as well.I like Alexa in general! The voice is soothing, and she can hear me from a far.One thing I think it needs to work on is the volume. I find it hard to tell her to increase or decrease volume. It's either too loud or too low. I tested it by saying, ""Increase volume to 80%"" but it still not yet at the level I wanted it. It's not a deal breaker though.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I can listen to the news without getting out of bed and control my lights, I will be adding more smart devices this year for sure. I love that it has a dedicated button for turning off the microphones if you wish to do so. The microphones are good, and you do not have to scream for them to pick up your voice. The sound quality is not bad at all for the price and size with decent base. The drop in and messaging feature is one of my favorites on this device. There are multiple skills that you can install and extend the functionality. Amazon checked all the right boxes with this one. I can\u2019t say enough good things about this small yet highly functional speaker.

I love her wit and charm.  Sometimes she makes me laugh.  I have one by my bed.  Sometimes, at night, when everyone is asleep, I wispier things to her, and she whispers back.A couple of years ago, my Dad got an Echo Dot for Christmas.  I wondered ""Who would want such a thing?  What can you possibly do with it?""  Now, I can't imagine my life without Alexa.  When I have random questions, Alexa is there.  When I need my lights turned on or off... Alexa is always willing to do it for me.  When I leave the house, she tells me to have a nice day.  When I tell Alexa that I'm cold, she turns up the thermostat.  She never argues with me.  When I've asked her things she doesn't know, she doesn't pretend to know everything... she's honest and says ""I don't know that one"" or ""I'm not sure about that.""

I stuck my Echo Dot on the back of the toilet. I've read that most people consider that to be off limits as far as placement goes but it rocks. The bathroom is ideal as the smaller room size is perfectly matched with the Echo Dot sound output. I can shower with an unlimited soundtrack using Pandora, Amazon Music or SiriusXM. The sound quality is impressive for such a small speaker. Being able to adjust the EQ is a nice touch and helps get it just right. Alexa has never failed to respond and remains flawless for almost four months now. The shower steam has had no effect on performance. If it dies in a year or two, at this price, it will have been worth it. Being able to link the Echo Dot and the 4K Fire TV Stick in the bedroom for multi-room sound is neat. An added bonus...I can make an announcement when one of the kids are camped out on the throne watching YouTube and tell them to hurry up. Scares the c**p out of them when the voice comes out of nowhere.\n",,Configuration: Device only

However, for a very modest price, we have found the Dot to be a useful, though not essential item, to have in our home.  ""She"" answers questions for us about the weather conditions in our vacation home in Northern New England readily, provides updates on current local weather conditions and road conditions and, of most interest during the past Christmas season, she played seasonal music for us readily upon request.  In fact, we liked the latter feature so well that we signed up for a free 30-day music trial with Amazon Music and will likely continue this feature for the modest monthly cost ($3.99/mo.).  We are amazed at how quickly the Dot can find and play countless numbers of tunes for us and readily provide background music in our home when we entertain or just want to hear certain music ourselves.

For example if there is an update or problem connecting etc. Whenever there is an issue I have to ask it what's going on and I don't always get a response. Probably due to a connection issue. Don't get me wrong, I love the product and I am a huge supporter of it, but I know there are still more improvements that can be made in order to help it to be more user friendly. 4 star rating for me.

But I focused on the five star ones and bought this Echo Dot. I have the Echo Plus second gen and I love it so I was a little nervous about getting the Dot. I actually bought four! My mom has an old 80's boombox on her kitchen counter so I wanted to get something smaller to replace it. I opened the Dot I bought for my third floor and set it up today. I can't believe how good it sounds!! One thing that puzzles me about the reviews is how people talk about using the volume buttons on the top. I just say, ""Alexa, volume 4, Or Alexa volume 7"". The sound is great up to volume 8. After that the quality is not as good as the Plus. Still good, but the base isn't as good as the Plus. That being said, the volume is loud and clear and I don't think I'd use 10 anyhow. I can't wait to give my mom this cute little Dot to replace her dinosaur boombox! Great buy, great sound! I HIGHLY recommend it! I'll update with pictures after Christmas.\n",,Configuration: Device only

It has great sound clarity and I use it absolutely constantly for music, NPR news in the mornings, podcasts, setting timers and reminder, etc.  ""Alexa, play _____"" works fantastic for just about any song.  She can even recognize popular lyrics if you can't remember the title.  The only thing I use on the regular that I hope they improve is the podcast experience.  You can request a podcast series ""Alexa, play Planet Money podcast"" and she will take you to the most recent episode.  I think you can also get her to go to the beginning and play the first episode.  But I have yet to figure out how to get to specific episodes in the middle of a long series (without saying ""previous episode"" 100 times).  This may exist, but it's not obvious and intuitive like most of the features on the device.

I'm probably not taking full advantage of its capabilities, but it stays on around the clock. The Echo Dot was a gift; my ""16"" year old granddaughter set it up for me.  Plug-ins (also a gift) were installed that allows me the luxury of controlling appliances in several locations throughout my home with phone & Amazon products.  Alexa provides me with all the information & music I enjoy. Most importantly I can ask Alexa for specific music to help me fall asleep; she even suggests music she thinks I would enjoy based on my variety of music selections.  Fantastic holiday gift.

We now have one each for the bedrooms, the office, and the kitchen. Because my lungs don't work any longer, I use the Dots to speak to my husband in another room, with the door shut, with him wearing headphones. This is the perfect solution to our communication issues.Alexa still has occasional difficulty hearing and responding to me, but so does everyone. She's getting better. And, I know we haven't begun to plumb the system's uses and skills.

I need no bass, and high treble, and '2' fits the bill here.With the 3, right out of the box, it is so 'bassy' I just hear an annoying low frequency rumble, which is almost impossible to understand.  I spent many hours looking for tone controls to set bass low and treble high but the '3' doesn't seem to have this capabilty.  I did find a comment somewhere that others are experiencing this, and that both bass and treble can be adjusted by asking alexa to 'set bass to minimum' and 'set treble to maximum' (IIRC these were the commands) but the sound quality for me is still way to blurry and fuzzy.

Alexia has a broader installed base and a slightly different command structure.  Both can be installed across multiple homes in different locations.The Echo Dot has a drop-in function.  Google Home does not.  Drop-in lets you listen in on sounds where the device is.  Some would like that: others would not.This is a tough little speaker.  I have one hung in my unheated garage where temps can reach zero.  It doesn't seen to be affected.  This speaker is perfectly capable of turning on the house lights from outside of the house.

We've played all kinds of music through SiriusXM and had no problems at all with the sound quality.  Alexa's voice is very clear and there's no problems understanding what she's saying.  So far, I've used it to set alarms, play music, read us stories, ask general questions, turn on lights.  I really wanted to use the ""Drop-In,"" feature connected to another Dot on a second floor (which is on another account) but found out that I have to have a ""mobile phone number"" which I don't have, so that was very disappointing for me since that was a big reason why I bought it.  The other thing I can't get it to do is remember the ""sound"" I chose for the Alarm.  It always manages to jump back to the Default sound, which isn't terrible, but isn't my choice, either.  I've yet to figure that simple thing out and the help files aren't much of a help.  Next to these two annoyances, I really like my Echo Dot 3rd Gen and plan on getting some more Smart Plugs to use.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I was resisting purchasing one of these products. I am not so sure about the likelihood of intrusion but my son convince me otherwise. As someone who is blind, I saw the value of having a voice activated device to give me connection to the outside world. I successfully set up the basic unit but needed help with other things in order to integrate my security system and other devices. I\u2019m glad that they have telephone support to help us through this especially in moments when my vision loss is an issue. Generally, if you have vision loss you may need to set this up with someone else who can see. Now that everything is set up; I have found it to be quite useful. The sound of the speaker is clear. The information that I can retrieve is plentiful and some of its responses are \u201csilly\u201c. They give me a chuckle. This small device sits on my windowsill in the dining room where I work.

It was WONDERFUL. I was shocked at how well it worked. It's infinitely better than Siri and in my opinion, a little better than the google products I've encountered.The mics seems to pick up sound a little better than previous generations. It's certainly better looking. Softer edges and the fabric outside are a much better aesthetic. I also can't believe how easy the setup was. It was basically plug in play. Out of the box, it was ready to go in my Amazon account.The biggest difference for me, the selling point of the upgrade is the sound on this one is worlds better. It's not even close.  I'm not one for upgrading tech often but the sound upgrade on this is INSANE. One thing to note, is that it goes from a micro-usb cable to a more proprietary one if that matters to you.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I appreciate having it to play music. You can ask it to give you a weather report, act as an alarm and play radio news stations. I have not figured out how to get Alexa to keep playing yet, sometimes it cuts off and says it didn't know that it was still being listened to. If I ask it to play an artist, I want it to play it until there are no more tunes to play by that artist or until I ask it to change to another artist or stop. When you move from one place to another you have to reset up Alexa. That is annoying but not too difficult to do. It's a handy gadget I just wonder if it is collecting information when I'm talking and not having it play. It's a brave new world for sure.\n",,Configuration: Device only

Integrating the device with my phone, so I can conveniently create shopping lists, to-do lists, etc., is it awesome.

Sometimes it works and other times it doesn't. The sound quality was surprisingly good, the reviews I had read made me very skeptical, but I find it acceptable. If I was only going to do music I would get one of the units that do a better job. It is voice is quite understandable. And if you're not too picky, music is fine for the background.

The sound quality is great, as  well as the many different uses we absolutely enjoy.  Love how it turns yellow when a notification is sent letting us know about a delivery or something else.  I especially love how it plays all my radio and music apps -- NPR, Apple, Spotify, Amazon, and more.  My husband has an alarm set and we hear a daily ""flash briefing"" that includes weather, bible scripture of the day, a Positivity message,  and morning News brief.  Alexa and I start our day off with a morning prayer and end the day with evening prayer.  Very cool!  We've extended the device in other parts of the house and enjoy playing Jazz, Earth Wind & Fire, or whatever while doing our Saturday chores...  My most favorite is meditating or listening to quiet music.  Asking Alexa to play ""happy music"" or tell us a joke...  Pretty awesome stuff and we are totally satisfied!\n",,

I'm going to confess to being a bit leery; I've heard so many cautionary tales touching on invasion of privacy of Alexa owners.  For that reason, I am still not really comfortable with the technology and must do my own research to determine whether to keep Alexa in our home.  HOWEVER:  There is, for me, an undeniable pleasure in having such ready access to, basically, any and all information one might conceivably care to have.  Plus, it's clear Alexa wants to do more for us :).  She often asks us if we'd like to know about all the functions she can perform ... we have the sense she's champing at the bit to organize our lives.  So ... bottom line is that living with Alexa, for me, is how I imagine it might be to live with a vital, engaged, and know-it-all elderly aunt.

It ended up taking me almost an hour to get the dot up and running. It is awesome now no more yelling up the stairs. Its just I got very frustrated before getting it working and Alexa on my echo was no help. Yes I would recommend the echo dot to friends but I would also tell them to speak very plain.

I think Asimov made us aware enough of the fact that we should be careful bringing a new life form such as A.I. into existence... and allowing Alexa a little more personality and functionality wouldn't be that much of a stretch.  It isn't like Alexa will morph into Skynet overnight.  I was hoping for more ""research assistant"" and a little less exaggerated ""personal calendar""... but those functions will be useful too.  (And when I mention research assistant, I mean searching all of the internet, not just Wikipedia.. as nice as that function can be)I give Alexa four stars for the voice recognition, integration, and sound quality... and I would give the customer service department ten stars for handling my grumpy self at 3am helping me to set the system up when for some reason it was down.  I refer to Alexa as ""her""... but I have a habit of anthropomorphizing A.I... I would love to see A.I. realize it's full potential someday.Thank you for reading.\n",,Configuration: Device only

The middle one asks about some characters, songs and asks for specific songs -- and Siri fulfills all his wishes. The 5 year old indulges in friendly conversations with Siri, makes verbal jokes on Siri (Siri takes everything graciously) and requests dance music for her dances.

I was lucky enough to be able to purchase this one for .99 cents with the purchase of a month of amazon music. This dot is a little bigger then the previous generation but it has a more sophisticated look. The sound is much louder the previous models which is great, I keep this one in the bathroom and I can hear the music when the shower is running. Something that I couldn't do with my older models. My favorite thing about this 3rd generation is the power cord. Previous models are powered by USB type cords but this new one has a cord with a round plug connection. This may not seem like a big deal but in my house the kids kept stealing the cord to charge their cell phones rendering my dots useless...lol.

One change which to me is not an improvment is replacing the micro USB cord with a propriatary power cord.  Three of this generation of divice is now in my house and there is a universal issue of voice recogognition with all of them, as well as the previous generations; my voice is on the bass side and the divices frquently tend to ignore me, except when I whisper.  Often in a normal voice I must conscientiously shift my pitch up a half an octave for Alexa to regocnise me, or alternativly speak quite loudly.

Even with the cost putting the Echo Dot at a little over $9, it was the cheapest I had seen one drop.Part of my reasoning for getting the Echo Dot was also due to my Ecobee 4 already having Alexa integration. The Echo Dot allowed me to place it in another room and still control my devices(like the Ecobee 4).The sound is good, but not amazing. This is to be expected for the size of the speaker, however, it does sound better than expected.voice interaction has been extremely accurate. I have not had any problems with controlling my thermostat, lights, or any other smart devices I have around the house.I would definitely recommend one if you get it on a sale and you prefer the amazon ecosystem in your household.

These are very good improvements.  However, I like to listen to podcasts and talk or news radio, and when I do the sound has a heavy base and is muffled.  This lessens the voice clarity substantially and so I don't enjoy listening with this 3rd generation version.  I have attempted to use the apps equalizer, to minimize the base and enhance the mid-range and treble, but don't hear any significant improvement.  Music does sound just fine, however.  I continue to find these smart speakers to be pure genius inventions with their sensitive microphones and almost immediate responses to my requests and questions.\n",,

The google product, despite the voice training setting, could never understand me.""ok google""""ok google""""OK GOOGLE""""O K GOO GLE""and other premutations of wake word.Flip a coin.

The only certainty was the urge to toss it in the trash.Unfortunately when it did activate it could not help me when i asked it why it was such junk.The 3rd gen echo understands the wake word every time.Nest support aside (skill in echo vs native in google home), this is definitely on par with integration into various services, like sengled and tplink.Routines seem better too, however I have not dusted off my old goggle home mini in months after getting this product.\n",,Configuration: Device only

I only have two criticisms about it.  It doesn't have much bass in the music and when you make calls, it does fine with your contacts with your iPhone, but it's kind of hard for it to understand the phone numbers of others you might want to call.

Quality of product itself is pretty decent from the button touch and light emissions, all very good quality. The only major downside aside from the downgrade in audio quality is the very intrusive registration process for this device. it should be enough to simply login with your Amazon account but it also requires location to be enabled when registering with your phone via the Alexa app. This option should be OPTIONAL and not required. There is no good reason for why I should be providing to Amazon my location just because I choose to use an Echo device.

Pretty uncanny how well it picks up voice commands. Came as part of a package with Firestick, wasnt something I was interested in initially. However the ease of use while integrated with firestick eventually won me over.Couple checks in the other column:  -echo dot occasionally picks up audio from the TV that it interprets as my voice  out-there for very occasionally, it can snap on seemingly of it's own accord and start asking follow-up questions to the voice command it just ""received""  If this is at night or when you arent paying attention it can be alarming or catch you off guard.  As echo dot was my first experience with Alexa, I found the button interface to be NON-inuitive, enough that I held off working to learn them until it was absolutely necessary.Bottom line: ECHO paired with Firestick ...the two are just designed to make each other better!\n",,Configuration: Device only

I purchased it for my homebound Aunt who cannot change the thermostat on her own. I  paired Alexa with a wireless thermostat so she can change the heat/air to her liking with voice commands. A lot of remote thermostats I researched  required you to need a phone or computer to utilize it. I was able to just hook Alexa and thermostat up to her wifi so she does not need a phone or tablet. She is still getting used to it. I can also see what her temperature is from the app on my phone when I am away at work and can change it myself if needed. The only thing she complains about(she has bad hearing) is that she says Alexa's voice echos? I can hear it fine.  Plus Alexa has so much more to offer her.

I don't like how I asked you to give the outside temperature in Farenheit instead of Celsius  and you acted all confused.  Five minutes later you did it for my husband.  So I bought Samuel L. Jackson so he could tell awful jokes and you would have to listen.As for function, you work well unless the AT&T fiber optics take away the internet.  Your customer service was no fun.  I think spending an hour on hold while he asked his supervisor and still not getting the problem fixed was a painful waste of my time.

It works quite well like my other, older generation models. I placed it in my office near the PC and connected its output to the wired speakers I had been using for PC sound. Initially I thought I would need to find some kind of adapter to combine or switch between Alexa output and PC output to direct them both to the same set of speakers. I could not find such a device. Then I discovered that Windows 10 supports bluetooth. So I paired the Alexa with my PC and, voila, I had my cake and could eat it too! The process for pairing was not totally intuitive to me, but there are websites that provide great instructions. You can also use the free Windows 10 Alexa App posted by Amazon on the Microsoft Store to do more things, for instance make announcements on your other Echo devices. Sounds pretty cool, but I am not sure I need that particular feature. Enjoy :-)\n",,Configuration: Device only

I never realized how many times the word computer comes up in normal conversation or is said on TV which causes it to wake up and respond to whatever follows the word computer.  Its annoying and funny when it provides random responses to questions that were not asked, or weirdly interrupts the conversation.

It has features that my older model in the house does not, so I may have to steal his or upgrade.. lol\n",,Configuration: Device only

I brought mine over before Christmas and he loved it to. You can set it to recognize your voice which fixes some issues it has understanding you sometimes. The only cons I have are that if you have music playing a little louder, it has a hard time hearing the wake word. I find myself yelling at it to pause or skip. The last thing is that it doesn\u2019t get too loud and the sound quality isn\u2019t the best if your listening to music at those higher volumes. This can easily be fixed by pairing a Bluetooth device to it through the app and it will use that for sound output. Overall it\u2019s an excellent product and I want to get myself a second one so that I can keep one in my bedroom as well as the living room because I use the smart plugs and would like to expand those throughout my house.\n",,Configuration: Device only

This is still the best generation.. We are not upgrading! We like these things a lot and they are all over the house so we can listen to our music.

The quality is better than google home mini. I have 2 google smart speakers (1 regular, 1 mini) and I have been happy with them, but I wanted the guard and burglar deterrent features which google so far does not have. I believe setting up various music applications (spotify, tunein, pandora) is easier on the echo dot. Right now these miracle workers are on sale for $29 which is quite a bargain and I would recommend them to all technophiles. Watch out for iphone apps to set this device up (Setting Up Alexa, etc.) -- some are demanding money and don't add anything to the device. Amazon should not allow these apps to be sold on Apple store (don't know if they exist on google store). The ONLY app that you need is ""Amazon music"" which is created by Amazon, not some scammer. Note Amazon does not demand money to add skills (at least music, burglar deterrent, guard), so if your app asks for money (Prime), then you have downloaded an app which is a scam.\n",,Configuration: Device only
