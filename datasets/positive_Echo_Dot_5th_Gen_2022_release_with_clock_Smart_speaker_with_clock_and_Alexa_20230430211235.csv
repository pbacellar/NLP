Echo_Dot_5th_Gen_2022_release_with_clock_Smart_speaker_with_clock_and_Alexa,39.99,,,Mustafa Ekinci,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on April 4, 2023",Compact Design Meets Improved Audio: The All-New Echo Dot with Clock Shines,"\nI recently upgraded to the All-New Echo Dot (5th Gen, 2022 release) with clock and have been thoroughly impressed with the enhancements over the previous generation. This smart speaker not only maintains the convenience and features I've come to expect from the Echo Dot series but also introduces welcome improvements to its design and audio performance.The new spherical design is aesthetically pleasing and fits seamlessly into any room. The addition of the LED clock display is a practical and stylish touch, making it easy to glance at the time without relying on voice commands. The display also shows the temperature and timers, which I've found particularly useful in the kitchen.When it comes to audio performance, the All-New Echo Dot has significantly improved. The 5th Gen speaker boasts richer sound and deeper bass, making music, podcasts, and even Alexa's responses much more enjoyable to listen to. The device easily fills a room with clear, high-quality audio.Setup and integration with the Alexa app are as simple as ever, and the Echo Dot continues to support an extensive range of smart home devices, making it a versatile hub for home automation. Voice recognition is accurate and responsive, even in noisy environments.The only minor downside I've noticed is that the LED clock display could be brighter, making it easier to see during the day. However, this is a minor issue that doesn't detract from the overall performance and appeal of the device.In summary, the All-New Echo Dot (5th Gen, 2022 release) with clock is a fantastic addition to the Echo family, offering improved audio quality and a stylish design while maintaining the versatility and convenience that users have come to expect. I highly recommend this smart speaker for anyone looking to enhance their smart home setup or simply enjoy a compact and powerful speaker.\n",16 people found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only
Echo_Dot_5th_Gen_2022_release_with_clock_Smart_speaker_with_clock_and_Alexa,39.99,,,Mark,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on April 5, 2023",Alexa with Light Sensing LED Clock!,"\nI've used Echo's for years. This is a nice update, with very good (not quite great) sound, small footprint, and nice appearance. I love the smart clock feature that will also ""echo"" other information such as the temperature when you ask for the weather, and the artist and track when you're listening to music.  It has a built-in motion sensor that you can use for programming events (using the Alexa App on your phone) such as turning on smart lights when you come into a room.  It also has a touch sensor so that when you tap the top, it will pause music or restart it.  It comes with a built-in thermometer that you can also use to program events such as turning on smart devices at certain temps.  the LED's will sense room light and  dim automatically in the dark, so you don't blind yourself at night, and you can set the base levels in the Alexa App.I bought two of these for our bathroom to listen to music and news while getting ready in the morning. You can pair them so they act as left and right speakers.  This works VERY well, they sound really good in paired stereo.  They will also share volume control, so changing the volume on one changes the volume on the other also.  When two Echos are in the same room, they will both activate with ""Alexa"" but only the closest one will respond to the command.By comparison, this Echo Dot sounds comparable to an Apple Home Pod mini (which I also use), but is far more functional, but less expensive, and it will still play the Apple Music service.

My old alarm had a terrible radio receiver and could barely get any stations. Plus, it only had two alarm settings, so I was changing it every weekend. With the Echo dot, I can have a different alarm time and sound for each day of the week. You can also set the alarms by voice or though the app - super easy. Plus I have the alarm connected to different stations. On weekdays I wake up to a Pandora station and on weekends it is tied to my XMSirius account. I love seeing the clock at night and the light adjusts automatically to the brightness of the room. I've changed the voice to a man's voice as my wife says she is the only woman who can give me directions - I'm old enough to go with the flow! I also like to ask for the day's weather before I get up and going, so just a handy device. I recommend!\n",47 people found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only

I love being able to play music in the shower, and I can have surround sound on that as well. For such a small piece of equipment, the sound quality is incredible.I originally purchased my first Echo because I was sleeping through my alarms, but no more of that! Not only can I set the alarms to be loud, but I got two Alexa-compatible light bulbs that turn on when my first alarm is dismissed.Alexa recorded that the smoke alarms were going off when no one was home, and since there was confirmed no fire once my grandma arrived home, I was able to get new smoke alarms quickly from Amazon.I\u2019m sure they\u2019re reading deeply into my recorded voice of me snoring and singing in the shower, but somehow, I ain\u2019t too worried.I regularly forget to turn my wax melt off until I am out running errands, so an Alexa-compatible plug helps me with that.My fan is a table fan, as there is no ceiling fan in my bedroom, and Alexa even turns it on for me, turns out the compatible light bulbs, adjusts the speaker volume to 5, and then plays half an hour of the best sleep music I\u2019ve ever had to help lull me to sleep from Apple Music.Originally I had difficulty connecting Apple Music to Alexa, but once I disconnected everything and tried again it has worked perfectly since.Alexa even reminds me to take my nightly medicine, of which is much less effective when you regularly forget to take it (lol), and I am much more consistent and feeling better overall as a result of these medication reminders. When I go to visit my parents, they have to remind me to take them otherwise I still forget sometimes.I\u2019ve even used Alexa to help me get out of the shower in a timely fashion, as sometimes the hot water is extremely inviting and I lose track of time, so I\u2019ll just set a music timer and be on my way to an appointment on time.I am a caregiver for my 82-year-old grandma, and so Alexa has notified me on my phone while I was away that there was a loud crash in the house, and I was able to check on her and make sure she was okay.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only

You learn so much and how to use it lol. Figure everything out on my own it was a struggle but worth it!If you are using led lights from daybetter and can\u2019t connect your led light to match with the music, you need to open the app of music so your led light music turns its mic on and once placed near Alexa so it can listen to the music it starts changing colors matching the beat.

I just get amazed that it is such a security device,  1) it can sense when someone is in the room and alert your phone. 2) it can be set to guard when you're away,  will alert your phone no matter where your at,  to smoke detection sounds,  carbon monoxide warning alarms,  again alert you if it detects motion. 3) it can even tell you the temperature of the room you have placed it,  besides of course tell you the outside temperature 4) this is a bit techie and some might not find useful,  but if and only if is the ""but"" to this,  but if you have an eero router,  this is more than capable of extending your wifi range,  I have used it and it absolutely extended my signal , super speeds,  no but enough for everyday use,  YouTube,  email Netflix,  yes it produces strong enough for that,  large files,  gaming,  wouldn't do, Bottom line for the extra security and piece of mind it provides it's cost is a drop in the bucket,  and I would like to add before ending the review  a thought on the  Amazon and Alexa are spying on us,  Well yes I suppose they could if they opted to,  However,  anything you use,  your cell phone,  your tablet,  your laptop,  by any maker,  Google,  Apple,  Samsung and yes Amazon,  if any of the above chose to break the strict laws,  yes,  it is a fact they could listen to you,  any product with a microphone and wifi or cellular connection,  the makers of that device could remotely listen,  I gotta believe everyone knows this,  So I often wonder why Alexa and Amazon take so much heat for this when as stated , ""any"" of the modern devices we use Could notice could do this,  I just don't think these billion dollar companies want to take the risk of being destroyed by listening in on what we might be having for dinner or if we broke wind,  lol I could see where if you were some major felon where you might be concerned,  lol, but us everyday people,  not so much,  and remember the mafia rule,  someone is always listening,  so pass notes and burn the notes instantly after being read,  sorry could not resist,  lol, again bottom line is we live in a world of technology,  and while it brings great features and skills,  it all comes with a risk\n",One person found this helpful,Color: Cloud BlueConfiguration: Device only

Echo dot 5 does not measure your indoor temperature nor displays the temperature of your city/location as it does with the time. It only temporarily displays the temperature for a couple of seconds when you use a vocal command to ask the temperature out there.It also does not find your wifi during setup if your cellphone is connected to a 5 ghz only router. I spent 30 minutes and couldn't setup my 5ghz wifi. I was able to setup a temporary wifi by connecting to a ""5ghz to 2.4 ghz wifi converter"" (this converter saved me so many times because many smart devices don't connect to 5ghz wifi and my internet provider got rid of 2.4 ghz band on the router that they offer and people don't know that their router has no 2.4 ghz until they try to connect a smart device to wifi). After connecting to the 2.4 ghz, I was able to switch the internet connection back to 5 ghz. Some people in the past used a computer connection to bypass the wifi setup issue but I tried it and it doesn't work anymore.\n",54 people found this helpful,Color: Cloud BlueConfiguration: Device only

Call me NUTS, but when you worked for 30+ years in the Airline industry and travel to many different Airports.  It is a God send to hear the LOCAL TIME IS NOW being announced throughout the Airport.Another critical thing is before your AMAZON ECHO DOT arrives at your home.  Download the APP and set it up on your cell or tablet and if you have an existing SMART HOME of devices (lights, plugs, tv, fan, microwave, refrigerator, washer, and driver) get them all dialed in as it was fast to do as we only use the GEENI APP with the Merkury Innovations Smart Home products and ALEXA has the GEENI Skills.This made last night's process of getting all the areas dialed into the ALEXA APP a breeze. I am ready to order another set of 5 devices to integrate into another home getting rid of GOOGLE once and for all.If you are on the fence like I was in buying these products, do your research, via YOUTUBE and watch the current video posted and do a GOOGLE search for the TOP features of ALEXA and again look at the most current stuff and NOT articles for 2015 to 2023 (LOL).This device runs circles around GOOGLE HOME and GOOGLE NEST/HUB Smart Home devices.

There was no trouble at all. You simply download the Alexa app and it basically sets up itself. Though I had previously linked it to amazon. It has been fun setting up routines and changing the voice. I have inquired about the weather and it seems to have been a truthful weather (person) so far. I purchased a second echo dot in order to have surround sound and the sound comes through very clearly and impressively.It kind of reminds me of playing with a furby when they first came out. Though furby's got old kind of quickly, alexa is like another person of which you have full control over...I gave this 4 stars as I did want to use the surround sound for my tv, which is a Roku, and it does not work for this purpose. Before purchase I read that alexa was compatible with a Roku smart tv. While this is true, only afterwards did I find out that this only means that alexa can turn the channel or the sound up on your tv, yet does not have the ability to use as a surround sound system for a Roku tv. Yet is supposedly only good for working with a fire tv. So am disappointed about this. But alexa is still fun to work with. Another thing is only a slight annoyance when playing songs. You ask alexa to play the song you would like, some songs are played freely, some songs you need a subscription for, then when the song is over alexa just keeps on playing unless you set a timer. So the annoyance comes as the song may be available and you just have to take a chance, or alexa shuffles similar music you may not like, or if allowed to keep playing may play music you possibly hate.I would suggest for the second echo dot since it does not have the screen/time feature that when setting the volume it could briefly tell you what volume it is on. Though you can ask it.Overall it has been very fun and I'm sure I will discover more ways to use this as life progresses. And since it was all so simple, I am considering buying more alexa's and more smart products in the future to extend to whole house. Happy and Delighted.

If so, take a pass on this...","\nDoes it do everything I expect an Alexa product to do? Yes. I'm dinging the device by one star because of the LCD Display. Unlike other reviewers, I have no issue with the display size (my 30's eyes that don't require aid from glasses can read it from across a room just fine). I bought 2 of these so that I could use them in two rooms I wanted a clock, rather than having to ask Alexa what time it was. One for the living room (near my entryway) so that I can easily check the time on my way in or out the door without having to wait for Alexa to respond or fumbling to pull my phone out, etc. I'm keeping the one I bought for my living room. Again, it does everything I expect an Alexa device to do.However, I'm returning the one I bought for my bedroom. 1) Amazon really needs to improve Alexa's ability to understand prompts about the user asking Alexa to adjust the brightness. At least for me, having a variety of other smart home products (lights, themes, zones, etc.) she is easily confused and doesn't seem to know that you just want her to either brighten or dim her own clock display. Half the time I ended up exasperated and just changed it within the Alexa App which was SUPER frustrating to have to do. 2) The LCD display has 12 brightness settings (0-10, plus 'off'). I was so excited for this product because I'm light sensitive and want my room DARK when I am sleeping, I thought surely all those settings would include one that was only the faintest glow to tell time in the middle of the night if you woke up. NOPE. The 0 setting still illuminates my entire room (albeit a smallish 12x12 bedroom) when all the lights are out. I ended up having to turn the display off every night, so it completely fell short of the goal I was trying to achieve in that sense. Maybe in the next generation Amazon will come up with more brightness settings. Or maybe a true 'bed time' clock mode or something.\n",14 people found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only

I will never buy a dot without LEDs in the future.  Alexa is very responsive and seems able to detect which machine is being directly addressed and respond appropriately.  They seem to have fixed the problem of awaking multiple Alexas with a single awake word.  This is a big quality of life upgrade.  No longer having to comunicate with the Dot in the living room when your intention is the Bathroom.  I've rigorously tested them putting as many as 6 Echo devices in a 12x20 room and consistently being addressed by the correct device.  I don't use Echo Dot's as music speakers but the sound clarity is noticeably better upgrading from 3rd gen.  I use Echo dots as a home upgrade for virtual assistant access from every corner of the house and serve to connect less frequented rooms to the home network.  With the additional wifi mesh capabilities of the new Dots, I am heavily considering switching to the Eero router.  I am an Amazon ecosystem fanboy so that is most likely my next tech purchase, an Eero 6 router.

There are not many children in our neighborhood and she can\u2019t visit her friends when we have bad weather.So for rainy days stuck at home she asks Alexa for answers to all the questions I\u2019d have to google. She also loves to play music from the Dot which has surprisingly good bass for such a small speaker!Her favorite feature though is asking Alexa to tell her a story. Alexa will give her 3-8min stories that keep her entertained.The clock on the Dot is something I think should become a standard on all devices like this, since it is now her primary alarm clock for school.But it\u2019s not just a clock, it can also display text off the song you\u2019re listening to!We limit my daughters screen time and video games, so this is an awesome entertainment alternative. She either learning facts, discovering music, hearing ghost stories, or being annoyed by her alarm in the morning. The Echo Dot really does it all.I have to take away one star for one complaint though.

Fieser,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on January 1, 2023",,"\nThe Alexa family just got a new addition with the fifth generation Echo Dot and we couldn't be happier! We already have six Echo Dots scattered throughout our home, so we were excited to see how the latest model compared to our trusty 4th gen devices. While the sound quality improvement from the 3rd to 4th gen was pretty noticeable, the upgrade from the 4th to 5th gen was less so. However, with a few adjustments to the tone settings in the Alexa app, we were able to get our 4th gen Echo Dot sounding pretty similar to the 5th gen.One thing we're not huge fans of is the bluish light of the built-in clock, especially in the bedroom. It would be great if there was an option to switch between red and blue lighting. Additionally, the font size of the clock is a bit small for our liking, making it hard to read from even a moderate distance. But, these are just minor quibbles for an otherwise amazing entry-level Echo device.In the middle ages, owning one of these futuristic devices would probably have gotten us accused of witchcraft. But nowadays, we're just grateful to have the convenience and assistance of Alexa at our fingertips. She's truly become a valued member of our family.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only

But after getting my Amazon Echo with that clock, it truly upgraded my living room with its design and compatibility with the smart lamps and cameras which sadly the homepods around the house cannot do. Im sure you probably seen a bunch of comparisons online on what should you choose when it comes to getting a smart home speaker to be the base of your smart home, and my personal opinion is that you wont regret getting the echo! The sound speaker is great with music! Tho on high volumes it doesn\u2019t do that great like the HomePod but it is still very good and loud, tho there is the echo studio if youre just looking for that loud smart speaker, tho from all the small speakers out there homepod mini takes the cup with echo right behind it, tho im totally convinced that the echo will be comparable if not better than what apple has to offer. The clock is a nice game changer, and the smart home features are excellent! And speaking with alexa is great she is such a helpful VA.

It had the amazing feature of two alarms settings.  That was just what I needed.  It disappointed in many ways.  1)  The display, even on the lowest setting, was too bright.  This is a big issue for a migraineur like me.  Also, the cat could walk by and set the display to the highest level.  This was also unacceptable. 2) No matter what you do, the clock wants to be wrong.  8 minutes wrong.  Really?  In 2022?When I saw the Echo Dot on sale for Black Friday, I jumped.  Here's what I love.  1) The display is smart.  It can be set higher during daylight hours and low as you want during nighttime hours.  This is all controlled by the Alexa app on your phone.  It's still too bright?  Just turn the unit off with the push of a button.  2) Setting alarms are as simple as talking to Alexa.  No overshooting your target time.  No setting and resetting.  It's just ""Alexa, set an alarm for 6:00am.""  If you need to, you can manage it on your phone.  3) You can set the sound as loud or soft as you like with +/- buttons on the top of the phone.  4) You can also set a quiet time if you don't want Alexa responding to any ambient noises during the night.  5) The time is always right.

I wanted to add a motion detection light switch to turn on the light automatically when he entered with wheelchair. However, the switch was mounted in such an way and area that it would not activate until he was well into the bathroom. I placed the new Dot with Clock on the vanity, created a routine, and it activates immediately as he approaches the door to the bathroom. One drawback is that a separate routine must be created to turn the light off and there is no way to shorten/lengthen the amount of time that the light stays on.

I tried everything for hours and hours and worked with Amazon staff THREE times.  1st time two hours, 2nd 1 hour, 3rd two hours.  NEVER got it to work more than an hour.THEN, I read one thing on some obscure web site saying, to fix it, you have to ASK for a specific ""GROUP"" when you ask it to play music.  I had made five groups.  Once I asked like, ""Alexa play music to group ""one that you have"" I used my ""ALL"" group,  ""IT SUDDENLY WORKED!""  WOW!  What a relief!  Before that, I could not play my music for two weeks and hours of trying got me no where, and the Amazon Help teams do NOT know this, ""ask for for a specific group thing.""I did not have to do that before, but somewhere along the line, I suppose in making several groups, the system got mixed up.  The ""KEY"" then is ASK for a SPECIFIC GROUP.Since dotin that, It is now defaulting to my ALL GROUP.  So now I don't have to ask for a specific group anymore.I sure hope the Amazon Help people are reading this and posting it in their notes.

Even at low volume the sound carries really well which is a big deal.  I paired the device with my fire Stick in the bedroom and that's where things got interesting.  It sounds great with the TV and it made the voices a lot clearer.  Small gripe it won't show you the volume level on the TV or even on the device when you're turning it up with the fire stick remote. Amazon should have it so that the TV displays what level you're turning it up to.  Major complaint is that it will absolutely Blair that the device is paired with the fire stick. So if I try to turn the TV on in the middle of the night I end up scaring this s*** out of my wife unless I remember to mute the device first.  That is extremely aggravating and there needs to be a way to turn that announcement off. I'm not the only user who's had that complaint about this.  I would also like it if you could change the LED brightness and color of the clock because when I wake up in the mornings the white can be pretty washed out.  Overall I like the device and I'm happy with it but the only thing keeping it from getting a five-star review is the Bluetooth announcement issue.\n,,Color: Cloud BlueConfiguration: Device only

The 4th Gen is now in another room.  The bedroom Echo is the one I use most, so I want it to have the best features.  Comparing the 5th Gen to the 4th Gen, the first thing you notice is the display.  The font is more \u201cblocky\u201d which at first I found less attractive, but it is easier to read especially at a distance.  The display now spells out things like temperature, and what song it playing which is a more useful feature than I expected.  The added display feature necessitated the font change, so I get it and I like it.  The next thing to note is the sound.  It is MUCH better.  The bass is fuller, the overall sound is much crisper, and there is less distortion at high volume.  I usually play music at night when I go to sleep, and I really appreciate the better, richer, fuller sound.  It is also nice to be able to pause and resume music with a tap rather than only by voice.  The indoor temperature sensor comes in handy to check the ambient temperature, and it can be used to automatically trigger smart climate controls if the room temperature goes out of my comfort zone.  This Echo also has a WiFi extender but it is not compatible with my home network, and I don\u2019t need it anyway.  I argued with myself when this 5th Gen Echo came out about whether I wanted to buy a whole new Echo for the added features.  I\u2019m glad I did.  I use this thing every day, and the new stuff make for a better and more satisfying user experience.\n",,Color: Cloud BlueConfiguration: Device only

However THIS is by far my FAVORITE! It has many different features than the others such as the clock, it\u2019s more than just a clock as I mentioned in my video above.It\u2019s such a beautiful color I also love that it\u2019s small and doesn\u2019t take up a big amount of space. I think that this is my favorite so far because of not only the clock but the ability for it to have such a nice sleek design without being too overbearing or dull looking. No offense yall lol I think that this color is just more my style as well as the entire design. The sound on this echo dot is amazing and I can hear it all the way from my bathroom on the other side of the house even on volume 4!! but one of my other favorite features of this echo dot is that it has a touch feature so if you set an alarm, you can basically enable the touch feature. I speak more about it in my video above, but it\u2019s just great. if you\u2019re debating on getting it or you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re gonna like it just get it you are not going to regret it!! in my opinion, it\u2019s different than the other Echo Dot, as well as the echo show because this one is pretty much both but in a different design and style but this one just also takes it to another level.

This thing is absolutely not a necessity, but you won't be able to stop playing with it. It's also aesthetically pleasing (I think mine is considered ""cloud blue). The directions are not correct.... you need to change your wifi setting to the one that says ""Amazon"" in order to do initial set up (after you see the orange light, which is discovery mode), then follow the prompts on the app, then the app will direct you to go back to your in-home wifi. Stay on the Amazon wifi until the app asks for the home wifi to be reconnected. The speaker sounds GREAT.

Love everything about them.  The clocks are easy to view from a distance.  The sound is better / fuller than the older gen 3 dots.  The built in temperature sensor appears quite accurate.  Oh one piece of advice, the Alexa command to give the temperature at the device location is, ""Alexa, what is the xxxxxx dot temperature?""  Where xxxxxx is whatever you name the echo dot in the Alexa app.  I couldn't find that anywhere but saw a youtube video giving it.

I guess anything with a screen tend to have that effect.  Switching to this Echo Dot with time serves the purpose without the problem for my kid.  Additionally, I found the Echo show to get quite warm just sitting there.  Understandable because of the screen.  So it was likely using electricity unnecessarily.

Two were delivered yesterday and the third one will arrive on Monday.I paired up the two that I have received as left and right speakers, and asked Alexa to play The Blend channel from Sirius XM for me. Let me tell you that I was quite impressed with the sound quality and ""stereoness"" that I was hearing coming out from these two little buddies. Overall, in my use case it's $60 (x2) well spent.Edit (10/24/2022)My third unit arrived today. I purchased it with the intention of using it as an eero extender, in addition to its usual functions as a music player, etc., via voice interaction in my bedroom. To my great dismay, the connection speed I received with the ""eero Built-in"" on was much lower than without. I tested this ""eero Built-in"" with the other two units: same disappointing results!  This third one will go back to Amazon tomorrow.  I am keeping the first two because I have continued to be happy with them as a ""stereo"" music player.Also, if you still want to try the ""eero Built-in"" feature by yourself, make sure the eero app software installed on your phone is up to date. Otherwise, the app will mislead you by keeping saying that you need to upgrade the software in the Echo Dot.

Granted it's a small display overall but it's nice to see the time, temp (with icon for the weather), song name, etc.Another nice upgrade is the temperature sensor in addition to the ultrasound motion sensor. This enables additional routines to be deployed, like adjusting your thermostat, turn a fan on/off, etc. After upgrading from a simple Dot, I set up routines to automatically turn a room's lights on and off when motion is detected, but only when it's dark out - and not past 11pm (bedtime). They also turn off again when no motion is detected.The sound is better over the prior generation; a hint more low-end and less tinny overall... Not Earth shattering by any means, but we'll take it.It's unfortunate that they removed the 3.5mm audio jack, but it's surely a pretty limited use-case.\n",25 people found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only

My last echo was having so many issues alarms kept shutting off after two rings, and then starting up about nine minutes later, and even if they went off They would only play for two seconds. I\u2019ve had my alarm just cancel without me even saying anything with my old Echo dot. my skills would not work. My routines would not work. I love the LED display on the echo. Dot fifth generation the sound is incredible. The way it displays the song titles is pretty cool I\u2019m glad they got rid of the headphone jack because to me it was useless so overall, I am loving the new fifth generation echo dot.

Works perfectly,"\nI have 5 dots scattered throughout my house. Online magazine reviews have been claiming that the things had a temperature sensor for several generations. The gen 5 seems to be the only one which actually does. Gen 4s definitely do not. I bought the latest (gen5) just to check the feature out. Note that you actually have to add the echo to a group in order to utilize the feature, like ""Alexa, what is the temperature in the bedroom"". The Dot matrix display is a nice touch and works just fine if the thing is sitting on a desk or something where you can see it. In my case it is mounted on the wall about 16 or 18 inches above my bed, so it is kind of an irrelevant feature.\n",,Color: Cloud BlueConfiguration: Device only

The LED display looks brighter to me than the previous version, and I prefer to have options like weather displayed, since I already have enough clocks that display the time.-The blue color version (Cloud Blue) now has a more grayish tone to the plastic base part.  The previous generation (Twilight Blue) had a bluer base, with blue-gray fabric.  Personally, I prefer this new color scheme.Other general thoughts about Echo Dot 5 family:-The speakers have been upgraded, now with more focus on low end and bass volume.  I have tested out a few different types of music, and I would agree that there is noticeable improvement, but really the speaker is still too small to be very impressive.  The sound is not even close to a regular Echo device, let alone higher quality speakers.  I appreciate the improvement here, but I still wouldn\u2019t choose to listen to music on these on a regular basis, especially at high volume where there is a bit of distortion.-I like the ability to be able to trigger routines based on temperature and motion, and stopping alarms by tapping is also a nice feature.  These additions offer many more useful automation options, and now having multiple Echo devices with temperature sensors can help identify differences in room temperature throughout the house.-The Eero Wi-Fi extender ability could actually be very useful for some people that need to extend the range of their network.  This was easy to configure with the Eero app, and it seems to be working well so far.Overall, this is a nice little upgrade from the previous version.  The LED display options are a cool new feature, especially the weather.  The speaker/sound improvement is nice, but not the biggest deal since these Echo Dots are still not the best choice for high volume music.  The sensors and Eero extender features are the biggest improvements, and these changes add so much extra functionality to an already useful smart speaker.  The lack of an audio-out port is the only downgrade, but that might be important to some people.  I also wish they included different color power adapters and cables, but that is also not the biggest deal.The increased functionality of the Dot family now makes these some of the best options available for smart speakers.  They are still low-priced options, but now can do even more than ever.  If you need something primarily for playing music, then you should still think about a higher end device like Echo or Echo Studio, but for everything else, these Dot devices are perfect.\n",,Color: Cloud BlueConfiguration: Device only
