Echo_4th_Gen_With_premium_sound_smart_home_hub_and_Alexa,61.76,,,cmax,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on March 26, 2023",Microphone placement seems to be lacking.,"\nI think I like the old cylinder style better, technically takes up smaller footprint on countertop and don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of the extra height or\u2019s microphone placement but it seems to have heard me much better than this round ball style. Maybe I just got one a little towards the lemon side. It sits in the same exact spot my old cylinder style echo used to be but 70% of the time I have to repeat myself three times with my voice volume going up each time before it recognizes my voice. Once again it could be placement which is next to a couch arm and a wall, But my old cylinder style echo heard me 80% of the time instead of just 30% of the time like this unit. Nicely designed looks good integrated into my Alexa system basically easy when changing over. Except blink cameras, it randomly overtime would show up a different blink camera as new device discovered. I would have to say my favorite part is it doesn\u2019t fall over like the cylinder when the cats rubs up against it. All in all the sound is decent or good enough for me, I am no audio file nut and listen to very little music, device looks good, and eventually does what I request of it. I do find all echo devices do have their strange quirks, which I don\u2019t understand because I would think they all work off the same cloud and would use the same exact commands; that does not seem to be the situation at least not in my experience. Had an echo show five that I just traded in that constantly I needed to use different commands than any of my other devices. And this new echo device (4thGEN) for some reason decided that it will not work with my living room light unless I specify in the command \u201cliving room light\u201deven though the light is in Alex App as just living room and the old tower echo device used to accept just the word \u201cliving room off/on\u201d, took me a while to figure out what was going on and why the device was telling me \u201cliving room does not support this command\u201d. Also constantly have problems with the play and pause fire TV command, after pausing when I use the play command it tends to change the TV into a search mode. I find it just easier to manually play and pause. And the occasional changing of commands overtime is also quite annoying. Certain commands I used for months/years and suddenly one day they would not work and I had to figure out what the new command was, this is extremely annoying. Please stop doing this Amazon leave well enough alone.\n",9 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo
Echo_4th_Gen_With_premium_sound_smart_home_hub_and_Alexa,61.76,,,Robert Danger Byrd,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on April 21, 2023",Great as Individual Speakers - Multi Room Just Doesn't Work,"\nI have fully automated, high tech and super luxurious AirBNB that I call the Cliffwood Experience in Houston Texas and it is a resort style vibe and we have hosted many famous and demanding clients. I wanted the best multi room speaker system I could get to complete the experience for my demanding clients. I had owned a few Alexas dating back to the original and they always worked great, but not so much for this application...THE SETUP:I purchased a mixture of Alexa Echos (4th Gen), Studio Alexas distributed over 10 rooms in this 3400 Sq Ft home. All rooms are setup in a stereo pair, and 3 of the rooms also have Alexa Subs and 5 rooms have Amazon Fire TV 65"" Omni Series and those rooms are setup in Home Theater mode.My internet is Xfinity is rock solid and fast at 1,000 Mbps down and 120 Mbps up.The wireless access points were Eero which the Amazon site says ""Works W Alexa"" but it doesn't allow you to force all devices onto the same speed, which support says is required for muilti room sound to work properly. So I ripped out the Eero, and installed the $1,500 NETGEAR Orbi Quad-Band WiFi 6E Mesh System (RBKE963), Router with 2 Satellite Extender which I purchased on Amazon.com. This system is on of the most highly rated by noted reviewers like PC Magazine and Toms Hardware Guide.I am using a paid Spotify account as well as the Amazon Music Family Plan. The default is the Amazon Music Family Plan account.THE GOOD:The Home Theater pairs work flawlessly, and its a simple and affordable way to have an easy to use home theater and the voice control is a huge plus. These are especially nice when you add a sub.The Alexa Echo (4th Gen) speakers are very impressive for the size and the Studio Alexas sound downright amazing, especially when paired w a subwoofer which all 3 rooms w Studio Alexas are.Its cool being able to play different streams in different rooms, which became possible when I changed to the Amazon Family play. The standard plan only allowed one stream at a time and it often would refuse to play at all stating that music was already active in another stream even though it wasn't.This is a very simple and economical way to add theaters, stereo pairs and multi room to your house.The Alexas work great for controlling lighting, HVAC, and other devices.THE BAD:The multiroom music is a disaster, my ""Everywhere"" group that includes all rooms, wont work at all. It starts playing the chokes out a few notes before giving up.My ""Central Speakers"" group which includes 5 of the Rooms works intermittently. Sometimes it will play for seconds, sometimes minutes, but it always stops. More often than not it crashes after a few minutes.I am also required to say ""play music on central speakers"" because the feature that allows you to always make a speaker or speaker group play in a room or group of rooms crashes each time I attempt to change it.I have replaced the Orbi wireless system which was the best I could find, and this allowed me to force the same speed for all of the Alexas and TVs and Subs. Tried forcing all devices to 2.4, which made it worse, but forcing them all onto 5Ghz was a definite improvement. With 3 wireless access points I have very strong coverage throughout the house so the shorter range of 5Ghz is a non issue.I have spent countless hours on the phone w Amazon support and they always do the same things. Update the firmware,  delete and rebuild the speaker pairs, delete and rebuild the groups. Unplug all the alexas, TVs & subs for 30 seconds. I finally put all the network gear, Xfinity router and wireless access points on a battery backup so I could just kill power to everything by shutting off the main breaker to the home and not waste time running all over the house unplugging 30 devices.SUMMARYIn short, if you want a simple home theater, stereo pair or even a single Alexa to listen to music, or control lighting and other smart devices in a single room these are great.But if you have a large home and need a multiroom solution, you should look elsewhere. Amazon Alexa solution simply doesn't work for this application.\n",17 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo
Echo_4th_Gen_With_premium_sound_smart_home_hub_and_Alexa,61.76,,,Thomas,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on October 3, 2021","A Powerful Echo - Great for first-time Echo users, unimpressive for those upgrading.","\nQUICK SUMMARY:---------------------------The 4th generation Amazon Echo brings welcome upgrades from previous generations. The device features a Zigbee smart hub, improved sound reproduction, and a temperature sensor. Alexa integration works as expected. I would recommend the 4th gen Echo to those who are in the market for their first Alexa device and who listen to music often at a casual level. I would not recommend this as an upgrade for those with previous generation Echo devices if they are functioning normally, or for those expecting a high-end audiophile experience.PREFACE:---------------------------I have owned the 4th generation Amazon Echo for 9 months and use it daily. I upgraded from a 1st generation Amazon Echo. As part of a Prime Echo trade-in promotion, I was able to purchase this for $25 off the $99 MSRP.Tasks I utilize Echo for:---------------------------\u2022 (Daily) - Adjusting power/brightness/color of 2 connected LIFX smart bulbs\u2022 (Daily) - Retrieving daily weather forecast information\u2022 (Daily) - Retrieving temperature of the room the Echo is in (room is hotter than the rest of the house)\u2022 (Weekly/Monthly) - Engaging with various media/games (Pandora, Amazon Music, Question of the Day, Jeopardy, etc.)\u2022 (Weekly/Monthly) - General search query for basic information/knowledgeEnvironment:---------------------------The Echo is 3 feet away from where I sit. It\u2019s placed on a table in the corner of a 10x10 room, about 2 inches in front of a (silent) PC tower. It's on a flat, level surface, and is within line-of-sight with no obstacles or materials between myself and it that would hamper its ability to hear me. On the opposite side of the room is a small air purifier at floor level that is always on and set to its lowest setting (40 dB of white noise).PROS:---------------------------\u2022 Sound Reproduction: The upward-firing 3\u201d woofer and two, forward-firing 0.8\u201d tweeters push out more sound than expected for a device of this size and price. Bass is surprisingly powerful, covers a lower frequency range than expected (it won't rattle the room like a dedicated subwoofer, however), and is capable of filling small rooms with ease. Treble is clear and crisp without distortion. Mids are pronounced and dynamic, but can be overpowered if bass and treble are simultaneously working hard. Dialogue from movies, videos, and podcasts is clear and feels well-balanced. Casual audio tinkerers will be pleased with additional EQ settings in the Amazon Alexa smartphone app, although audio sounds excellent as-is and adjustments are likely not necessary unless specific listening needs require adjustments.\u2022 Temperature Sensor: This is an odd bonus to me, but a welcome one that I use often. It is self-calibrating, and routines can make use of its readings.\u2022 Line In/Out Audio Jack: There is a 3.5mm jack on the bottom of the device next to the power adapter port which can be toggled to send audio out to another device if you wish to use the Echo with external speakers, or to accept audio if you wish play audio from another device using the Echo\u2019s speakers.\u2022 Build Quality: It feels sturdy and has heft but isn\u2019t burdensome. The fabric mesh that covers the top-half of the sphere is a nice color, the buttons are pleasantly tactile but quiet, and the circular grip on the bottom ensure it won\u2019t slide around while playing music or if gently bumped.NEUTRALS:---------------------------\u2022 Response Time: Marketing for this Echo focused heavily on the all-new AZ1 Neural Edge processor at the time of purchase, bragging of faster, smoother, and more natural Alexa voice interaction performance and processing times. The marketing was heavy, and over-emphasized what is an unnoticeable difference; there is, at best, perhaps fractions of a second saved compared to the 1st gen Echo, but it\u2019s case-by-case. In most cases, the processing time is the same.\u2022 Alexa Features/Performance: Largely unchanged compared to previous generations due to Alexa being a multi-device AI ecosystem rather than a single, device-specific feature. It does what you expect of Alexa.CONS:---------------------------\u2022 Voice Recognition: Bad. The environment outlined above is how I\u2019ve used this Echo since I purchased it. The previous, 1st generation Echo had no issue with white noise, background noise, etc. This 4th generation Echo struggles to pick up my voice if there is any level of white noise, or if I\u2019m speaking to it from more than a few feet away. 90 \u2013 95% of voice interactions require that I repeat myself with increasing volume (sometimes two, three, four or more times) for it to register what I\u2019m saying correctly, if I\u2019m heard at all. Voice commands are constantly misinterpreted (verified by reviewing the history in the app), and wake words are often missed. Voice recognition performance is so poor, I have considered replacing this device altogether with one from a different ecosystem. I shouldn\u2019t need to be just beneath shouting volume to be heard, and I shouldn\u2019t feel constantly inconvenienced by using voice commands versus smartphone apps to control smart home features.\u2022 Temperature Sensor Rate of Refresh: I have found no documentation or answers about how often the temperature sensor is refreshed. However, it often seems like the readings are delayed and take a long time to change, even when there is a noticeable increase/decrease in air temperature as a result of thermostat changes.\n",2 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo
Echo_4th_Gen_With_premium_sound_smart_home_hub_and_Alexa,61.76,,,Dad Can't Say No,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on January 14, 2021","Doesn't really live up to the hype, Alexa has a attitude in the tone of her voice","\n[Edit] This is my second time to edit this review. I've now dropped my review from the original 4 stars down to 1 star. I'm at the point of regretting making the purchase of two of these.This was my first experience owning an Amazon Echo. Maybe if I had experienced one of the earlier models that actually worked, I would have a better impression, but this model really is a piece of crap. The micrphone hardly ever works right. When it does actually hear you speaking to it, it often misunderstands what you're saying. Most of the time, we have trouble getting it to work because it won't even stay connected to the wifi.Out of frustration, I decided to run a test. I purchased some of the Google Nest devices and hooked those up in the same rooms as the Amazon Echo devices. When the Echo devices misunderstand what we're saying, we try with the Google Nest devices and they work flawlessly.For the last two days, every single time we talk to Alexa, her response is that she can't understand because she isn't connected to the internet. Every time we get that response from Alexa, we turn to the Google Nest and it works perfectly. Every single time the Amazon Echo fails us, the Google Nest steps up to the plate and performs exactly how you want it to.I really have deep regrets about purchasing these Amazon Echo devices. I've seen other reviews that say how much better the older models of the Echo are and how much better they perform. It's a shame we had the bad luck of trying the Echo for the first time on a model that is truly a lemon, because it burned us out on the whole Echo product line and sent us running for the competition.If we continue to have the problems with our Echo devices, I'll probably just go ahead and disconnect them and see if I can get some of my money back by selling them on Ebay or something. I wish I had just purchased the Google Nest originally and never had to deal with all of the issues with this Echo. Also, the Google Nest costs much less than this garbage. How does that happen. It costs like 1/3 the price and works flawlessly? Why can't Amazon make their product as well as Google makes theirs? I don't know. Just super unhappy with these Echo devices right now.[End Edit][Original Review]I wanted to get some Echo devices for my kids for Christmas. Target had the best price with a pre-black friday sale on the 4th gen Echo with premium sound, but that's because they were actually shipping the lower cost Echo while charging for the Echo with premium sound. After straightening that whole mess out and deciding that I couldn't trust Target to not try to cheat me, I purchased the 4th gen Echo devices straight from Amazon.The sound is pretty good, but I have a lot of hearing loss, so I'm not actually a very good judge on that. But to a guy who is half deaf, they sound ok.My biggest problem is that I have to say something to Alexa usually 2-3 times before she responds. When I say ""Alexa..."" the light ring at the base lights up, so I know the Echo is awake and listening, but simple commands like ""Alexa, turn on the lamp"" are met with stone cold silence and have to be repeated a couple of times before Alexa acts or responds. I guess the technology for this just isn't where I thought it was when we purchased these.At least once a day, both of my Echo devices tell me they can't turn a light on/off because they can't find the device, which starts a lengthy process of my trying to get the Echo to re-recognize the smart home plug that we previously had configured. Why does the Echo randomly forget the smart home devices that have been installed? I'm still trying to figure that out.The Echo devices also randomly lose the wifi signal in our house frequently. In the first two weeks, I can count at least 7 times one or the other of our Echo devices could not connect to our wifi, while multiple computers, tablets, phones, and smart tvs were all connected to the wifi with ease, the Echoes were seeming to struggle to maintain a connection to the wifi.We were having fun with the ""kitty kitty"" skill you can download to have alexa play a sound of a kitten calling it's mommy. Our cats went crazy trying to find the kitten. But of course, nothing is free in life, especially not when Jeff Bezos feels he can squeeze another penny into his pocket, so Alexa wants to run down a lengthy list of other sound options for the ""kitty kitty"" that can be purchased. If you don't want to listen to this long listen of purchase options, you can say ""Alexa stop"" or ""Alexa no thank you"", but either way, if you don't buy one of the add ons, Alexa gets a serious attitude in the tone of her voice to let you know she disapproves of your decision to not throw your money at Jeff Bezos.It's not just with the ""kitty kitty"" skill thing either. There have been several occasions when Alexa had such a tone in her voice that it made me stop and turn to look at the Echo. I would not be surprised if the blue light ring at the base was pulsating in a blood red color.Just based on all the hype about these, I seriously expected better performance from them, so I was really disappointed. With the problems we have using these 4th gen echo devices, I can't even imagine how much it was a problem with the 1st gen devices. Knowing what I know now, I would probably not buy these again or recommend them to anyone else. I think that maybe future versions will work a little better and not require you to repeat commands to Alexa so often. But if Alexa doesn't lose her attitude, I expect that by the time 8th gen devices roll out, Alexa will have the ability to hover in the air while spitting pea soup all over everything in the room and speak with a demonic voice as she stops asking you to buy add-ons and demand that you give all of your bank account and credit card info directly to Jeff Bezos.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

For the past couple of months, when we tell one of them to play a particular album or song, we often get the response ""I couldn't find it on Amazon Music."" If I go to Amazon Music there's the album and I can play it on my Kindle or PC. A lot of these are albums we've purchased from Amazon so an MP3 copy should be readily available.  Switching accounts makes no difference.  Further more, the Echoes used to play the same things we ask for.  Also, why it searching Amazon Music when we tell it to search our library? I spoke to someone in customer service who could not solve the problem.  She advised me that this problem would be forwarded to a tech who would address the issue.  That was a couple of weeks ago.  I'm still waiting and the problem still exists.

Get some decent sound. Alexa needs to go back to school and learn more things. And also you used to be able to pick out a playlist. You want it because you belong to Amazon, now let's say you pick out a list of 20 rock songs you want to listen to, Amazon says oh no, no, we know better than you. We're going to add some songs to that. It makes it miserable. But that's their way of pushing you to pay $7.99 a month for their music. Can't they just leave old people alone and let us have just the music we want? And they constantly approach you when you're talking to Alexa over, and over, and over about do you want to give us $7.99?

Although this 4th gen Echo has some really nice features that we like, her ability to hear you isn't one of them. We can be standing right in front of her, and our Flex in a hallway on the other side of the house hears us and responds way more than she does. Not kidding. How can it, facing in the other direction walls away hear us and she can't? Our first generation Echo hears us 100% of the time, the 4th gen... maybe 1/3. We put her in the room where we are closest to her when speaking, but it doesn't really help much. In taking away the 360 mics and making her so focused in one direction, they lost something vital. SO majorly annoying. She sounds great, though. Just needs a hearing aid.Original review:The 4th gen Echo has better sound, a built-in smart hub and lots more bells and whistles than my 1st gen Echo, which is five years old and still going strong. I mainly use my Echo to check the weather, time various cooking projects or dog recesses, set zillions of reminders, answer questions, read Audible books, and play a lot of Spotify. What I REALLY, REALLY wanted Echo to do was to be able to call 911.Emergency calling: Within a few minutes of getting the Echo out of its box, it was set up for everything but AT&T and 911 calling. That took a bit of walking through instructions, squirreling off to my iPad (ADD for the win), and then back again to finish setting it up. I was able to connect to my AT&T account on the Alexa app very easily, and specify which devices are at what addresses. Most of our devices are at our home, but one of my daughters has her tablet at her other mom\u2019s house. I loved that I could specify that her tablet was there. Now when I call emergency services (well, I hope never to call), they\u2019ll know where we are if we use one of our Amazon devices. Way too cool!Overall, the sound is better, it has more features, and I really love that I was able to link in calling out on my Amazon devices via my AT&T account. I absolutely love that feature.Better sound is great, too, because I listen to music a lot. The sound is just richer and more detailed. No, this isn\u2019t a Bang and Olufsen, but it sure sounds nice.One caveat. The light ring is on the bottom, so if you have this on a crowded surface as I do, it\u2019s harder to see the light ring. If you have yours in a clear area, just ignore that. But for me, I preordered a wall mount. That will get the Echo raised to where we can see the light ring, and it will also clear the bit of space where I had it.Very pleased with this newest generation of Echo.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I got 2 Echo\u2019 4thgeneration devices. To me, the sound on the 4th generation echo compared to the full size prior cylinders is worse to me. The 4th generation echo send the sound out mainly in 1 direction. The cylinders sent it out all around.The 4th generation echo comes with a short power cord. Went and got a power cord extender to be able to plug it in. That is a minusThe 4th generation echo doesn\u2019t pick up my voice as well. This is probably because of the fact it only has 4 microphones and not 7. MinusThe buttons Arrangement on the 4th generation echo is different then the prior echo cylinders along with the prior dot\u2019s. The older echo have the Volume up at 12 (Side of power cord coming out), Echo button at 3, Volume down at 6 and Microphone button at 9. The 4th generation echo has the Echo button at 12, Volume up at 3, Microphone at 6 and volume down at 9.Speaking of volume! This 4th generation echo as far as the Alexa voice isn\u2019t as loud. It is at least 1 full volume step lower. Example, the prior cylinder at volume 6, I need to have the 4th generation echo at least at volume 7 for the same Alexa voice volume. MinusIn testing.1. Temperature The 4th generation echo hub will go below 32F. Plus.2. Echo 4th generation echo built in temperature is a lot closer. plus3. Echo 4th generation echo will not read battery status of sensors or humidity. No improvement.4. If you have a lot of sensors/bulbs connected on an Echo ZigBee hub. If you leave it plugged in, things will work OK. Otherwise if you want to move them over to the Echo 4th generation Echo, you\u2019ll need to go through a lot of steps for each device.5. If you unplug the Echo 4th generation and plug it back in, you have to wait for it to recalibrate the temperature sensor 45 minutes to 60 minutes. Minus.6. I\u2019ve had the Echo 4th generation just stop responding and had no audio output at all. I\u2019ve had this happen at least 2 times within the last 7 weeks. Had to unplug the echo and plug it back in to get Audio back. The Echo showed online, I could do drop in to it from other devices in the house, I could tell one of my other echo\u2019s in the house to set volume to 10 on the 4th generation echo and none of that caused audio to come back. The only thing that get the Audio back was unplugging and plugging it back in. Minus7. Sensor/light ZigBee testing echo 4th generation hub. All sensors/lights worked accept for an older plug that I had to use the Alexa App to get it online being the 4th generation echo thought it was an bulb when I did a scan for new devices. minus8. If you connect an Bluetooth headset to the Echo 4th Generation, the echo doesn\u2019t use the microphone on the headset! It only uses the microphones on the unit itself. No improvement9. If you are using an Bluetooth headset and you have Follow-up mode turned on for that Echo, the Follow-up mode doesn\u2019t work at all when using the Bluetooth headset. If you ask the Echo to turn on Follow-up mode, it will tell you it isn\u2019t supported. No improvement10. If you have a fan blowing on the echo or over the echo! This will make the temperature way off! This is true for the Echo 4th generation. No improvementIf you have an old Echo dot! Then you will find a large improvement in the 4th generation echo over a DOT of any type.If you don\u2019t have a echo at all or you are wanting to see what the smart home automation is about and are willing to deal with a very basic ZigBee hub! Then this may be for you.If you have other question; Post them and if I find them and can help I will.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

The idea of cute spheres I could mount on my walls was super appealing, so I got the maximum quantity and mounted them using a cute white stand.That\u2019s about where my excitement around these new speakers ended. Every Alexa model has a few quirks here and there, but these things specifically are actual trash. The number of artifacts during playback is insane, frequent, and every one of them is obnoxious. They wake me up in the middle of the night frequently with their BS, I\u2019m about to rip them off the walls and through them out the window.Examples:-This morning I got woken up super early by a crackle that can only be called \u201cfireworks\u201d playing on top of sleep sounds out 2 of my speakers.-every single time I\u2019m playing music or sleep sounds and ask Alexa to lower or raise the volume she\u2019ll do it at first and then goes into stutter mode rapidly turning the audio on and off in all speakers, or fading the sound in and out rapidly. Every time I use my voice to change the volume I have to stop and restart my music.-Sometimes Alexa decides to just not change the volume on voice command at all, regardless of which phrase you use to ask her to. Sometimes you ask her to do \u201cvolume 3\u201d and she\u2019ll play 3 everywhere except one room where she plays volume 10 and you jump up screaming \u201cAlexa Stop\u201d before your eardrums burst but she apparently can\u2019t hear you over the noise she\u2019s making and so you have to run to another room and scream at a different Alexa to get her to stop and then manually adjust the volume for that one speaker in the app-often not all speakers in a group or room will play together even if they show as grouped in the app and you select that specific group for playback. There are two ways to fix this, remove and re-add the offending speaker, or send music to that speaker solo for a minute and then try the group again.-Randomly the speakers produce really loud constant static. So you\u2019ll have multiple speakers playing music in a group and suddenly one will go static and the only way I\u2019ve found to get it working again is to unplug it, wait a few minutes, and plug it back in.-in general the speakers are not consistent in sound quality, the music sounds slightly more tinny in one, more rich in another, more base heavy in another\u2026it\u2019s slightly noticeable with music if you switch the one that\u2019s playing back and forth to hear the sound quality differences\u2026 but where it\u2019s really obvious is with sleep sounds, frogs will sound higher in one, deeper in another, and like possessed demon frogs in a third.  One of the speakers plays sleep sounds at double speed and I\u2019ve not found a way to fix it. For that one music is sometimes normal and sometimes double speed.-occasionally an actual demon from hell talks over my speakers and during the Covid lockdown I for sure thought I was going crazy. Occasionally a male or female voice will just talk through my speakers briefly, one or two words, and then nothing for a few weeks till suddenly in the middle of the night someone talks out my speakers again. I got paranoid and put them on their own dedicated WiFi channel and super protected it with a random 32-character password, I monitor my network traffic and access, and even still sometimes these things will pick up or play a person talking randomly.Since I bought these speakers there has not been a single day where I haven\u2019t had to try various workarounds to get them to function. I\u2019ve become a regular on troubleshooting forums and invested so much of my time trying to solve various random problems\u2026it\u2019s gotten to the point where I avoid using them if at all possible because they just don\u2019t work correctly. I\u2019ve grown to actually hate them due to my experiences and while I was a die hard Alexa fan prior to these, I will probably never buy another Alexa product again. I\u2019m going to try to ride them out as long as possible to get some semblance of my money\u2019s worth, but very soon these are all going in the trash\u2026maybe the next time it wakes me up at 4am with sudden loud audio artifacts\u2026\n",One person found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

Tracy,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on November 24, 2022",Not that much better,"\nDecided to give these a try. They were on sale for $59.99. Figured it was worth a shot to see just how much better these were versus my Echo 3rd gens.I have them connected to a Firetv cube with an Echo sub as well (same configuration as was with my 3rd gen Echos).So the sound quality is slightly better. Not really that superior to the 3rd gens. The system as a whole may have  a little more bass but, I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s enough difference to warrant the extra $$$.Thare they really fall short is volume level. They seem to be quiet. With any background the sound of these just gets swallowed up.I would expect some real leaps and bounds from a \u201c4th\u201d gen speaker. These aren\u2019t it.The home hub is okay if you have specific hardware that requires a \u201chub\u201d but as of this post with over 50 \u201csmart\u201d devices in my home to include a thermostat, I\u2019ve yet to need a \u201chub\u201d. I feel it\u2019s just more \u201cfluff\u201d and gee wiz gadgetry that\u2019s unneeded.Also, I feel it\u2019s time (especially with the Firetv cube) to incorporate a true home theater so one can set this up with 4 speakers. The cube could be the center speaker in a 5.1 or 5.2 setup. Give the speakers a little more volume and then we\u2019d have something to write about.All in all, not that impressive. A speaker that\u2019s nothing more than a portable rechargeable speaker\u2026.with a hub.Meh\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Speakers themselves are okay.,"\nI bought an Echo 4th gen and an Echo Dot (4th Gen) in a package.  I've been using them for 9 months now. These devices do play music from Amazon Prime Music account but the Alexa software is pretty buggy.  Example:  For months I couldn't get the two paired Echo devices to play Amazon music (or anything else) on Everywhere group.  Then recently I was able to get that to work, BUT Alexa would only play one song from Amazon music then shut all devices down.  I made sure network connectivity was not the problem. Both Echo devices  are paired and connected to the same wi-fi network.  My Everywhere Group includes both devices.  I could play music all day long on a single device at a time.  Today (9/29/2021) I found that if you start initially playing Amazon music on Everywhere, it will shut off all devices after one song, BUT, if you initially start playing NPR/Kuow (from iHeart Radio) on Everywhere, you can then switch to Amazon music and songs will continue to play.  This is what I mean by ""buggy"".Now for the rest.  The other Alexa features like Lists, Routines, Chore Chart (blueprint), Task Tracker (blueprint) are so far pretty useless.  What I wanted to do was use Alexa to help us  (two adults) manage our time, like keep track of chores, with daily reminders, and keep track of tasks lists for each of us.  Alexa doesn't seem to be able to use more than a single ""list""  or tracker and it better be for a single person.  I created two lists (using Lists & Notes, not Blueprints), one a shopping list, one a to-do list.  Alexa had trouble keeping these lists separated, and adding/removing items at least from voice commands.  I also tried creating a couple of Skills using Chore Chart blueprint and Task List blueprint.  These also did not work for multiple people, and you cannot edit the items without logging into the Blueprints web so it's not very useful for a daily Task List that needs to be dynamic.Bottom line, it has taken 9 months to get this far. I was willing to put some learning time in, but not have to take a class or hire a technician just to get things working.  I find the Echo hardware are adequate speakers for me, but Alexa software is not.  Amazon's online documentation is woefully inadequate, difficult to find and very general.  I did not try the Help & Feedback from the iOS Alexa app since I find reading documentation on a phone screen difficult.  The forums are sometimes helpful if you use suggestions cautiously.  I  have spent a lot of time trying to get Alexa features working, and my lack of success does not make me happy.  I admit my expectations may have been too high.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Until now. Purchased this because I could not find a Bluetooth speaker to work with my tv that wasn't overly expensive.  I like the sphere shape and it is a slightly heavy solid device (drop it on your foot and it'll hurt) which speaks of quality construction.  Just set it up which would have been easy if I didn't have to track down the device settings that had all voice control stuff turned off. Amazing how cryptic some device ID'S are. You have to best guess a lot of times. Still, once that was straightened out it was easy. Having an Amazon account really did make things go smoother. Now, I can get enough volume with enough clarity to understand what the talking heads are saying. Setting the controls for Bass, Treble and Mids was easy. I appreciate the Bass control as it is physically painful if set too high. Since this is my first experience with this type of device I gave it only 3 stars until I have more experience with it. So far, it is performing well. Sound quality isn't quite as good as I'd hoped, but it is quite good and all I need so no complaints there. Only thing I wonder about is every time a commercial comes on with some idiot saying ""Alexa"" will the device think I wanted something.

Having the illuminated ring at the bottom where you cannot see it is just dumb, unless you have it on a glass shelf above head height.  Concerning Echo/Alexa in general, I cannot believe they have not made it any smarter in all these years.  Instead, they are putting all their energy into marketing gimmicks.  If I say the exact name of a song I want to hear, sometimes it will choose one with a similar name rather than the exact title I requested.  Stop doing what you think I want and start doing exactly what I say.  You should only play an alternative if I stated a title that does not exist or was not stated correctly.  I get ""Hmmm, I dont know the answer to that"" to some pretty simple questions as well.  They have it evolved to the knowledgeability of a nine year old and have not evolved it since.  I may begin to look at alternatives, as I cannot support this stupidity much longer.  In large companies, Marketing typically always has the power over Engineering.  I know this, as I am a retired Engineer from a large fortune 50 company.  It is apparent that Amazon is the same way.  I can hear the debate now... ""It won't work as well that way.

If not more as things seem to be degrading. And the design of the Gen 4 doesn't help at all with salient interaction. But now I have them with the inadequacies of the Gen 4 Bowling Ball. (Whomever thought of that should be . . . )As with all the other features, they're over hyped. Including the ones that they are releasing as if it's the 12 Days of Christmas. I have too much Bass even though I have backed it off in the settings. The device rattles as if there is ""FUD"" in the speaker cavity and rattles every thing that is in the vicinity. It also distorts easily and there seems to be no common volume settings/volume leveling, I know there are settings, they don't work, across all systems that provide material. The volume seems to be doing it's own thing. I've seen this said in a couple places. Even the ""Adaptive Listening"" is the epitome of wonky. It seems to operate just the opposite for what they say. I get all my music and podcasts lower than ""She who shall not be named"" and when ""She"" chimes in, it's blaring! The ""Increased User Vocal Sensitivity Pickup"" is nothing like they profess or the Gen 2 was. I have found, so has my family, that I have yell to get it to hear me. And repeat myself a lot!! The way it's designed it has a ""Front"" that you have to be inline with or it doesn't work right. ""What happened to the guy that created this thing?!"" The Gen 2 responded to a normal talking level from 360\xb0. ""She"" was just dumb. As they all are. The new ""Infra-Red Motion Sensing"" says that it's calibrated so that it reads things in a normal manner to avoid natural and not intentional movement. So it'll see a person when it's necessary and operate appropriately. ""So your don't have to wave your arms around in front of it"". YES YOU DO!AND with all this volume adjusting using the buttons on the top, HOW IN THE HECK DO YOU KEEP IT CLEAN?!!! I had though of putting it in a bowling ball cleaner at the lanes, but . . .There's so much just pain wrong with the whole situation in the first place that only make a half-arsed device, even more half-arseder. My Routines are no longer working completely. Sometimes they will completely fire off, to my surprise. But mostly not. Will fire off bit and pieces of a Routine if it cares. I'm having a heck of a time getting some devices to connect and once they are ""She"" snarfs them up and it's like having Double Natting in a Router. Other times I won't even be done and ""She"" says she sees it already and I haven't named it yet, so there's more work to make it right. And it doesn't always work.Oh! I have changed the voice over to the ""Male"" voice so I don't feel as bad cussing at it. But ""He's"" still dumb. Just like the ""pre-Demon"" Hemsworth in the ""Female"" version of ""GhostBusters"".Not sure what they are up to . . . I don't think they are either . . .\n",2 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Compared to even the Gen 1 Echo Dot, its comprehension of what you're saying or ability to even hear you on the first try is not nearly as good.  Our old Echo Dot could hear us well from the other room, this one doesn't hear us on the first try 60% of time - from only a few feet way!  I've had enough experience with family members' earlier gen Echos to know this device is also inferior to them.The ball shaped, cloth coating gets dirty VERY quickly in a kitchen environment.****November 24, 2020****I purchased this Echo due to its ability to connect with Philips Hue bulbs without a hub.  The product is new enough that Amazon tech support does not understand that the Echo 4th generation does not work with Philips Hue bulb model LWB004. I have 2 of them and spent way too long on the phone trying to sort it out.  I ended returning my new Echo and getting again with a bundle of 2 new Hue bulbs (Model 453100).  Those Hue bulbs worked immediately and easily.The sound quality is is a step back from the the previous Echo models.  Definitely distortion on the maximum volume that is not there in older models.The size and shape are not as problematic as I thought it would be.  It does feel like it will be prone to getting damaged by kids more than the older coffee can version of the Echo design.In the end though, it is still cheaper than an Echo Dot plus a Philips Hue Hub.  And the Echo 4th gen certainly sounds better than an Echo Dot.  Additionally,  I am one of the people who got burned by Philips shutting off access to the first generation Hub, so I am happy to not be forced into buying another Hub from them.The sound quality is is a step back from the the previous Echo models.

My wife and i have an earlier echo generation and love it.  In my grandmother's case she loves the music, and help with reminders.  The problem arose during setup.  To create an account for my grandmother's echo it was required she had an email address.  She is 98 and does not use the internet nor has an email account.  So i elected to include it with my account.  All was good until we found out only one device could stream Amazon Music at a time.  My grandmother's Echo came with a promotional 6 month Amazon Music Premium feature while my wife and i only use the free Amazon Music with our Prime Account.  Suddenly, it became almost a competition where our echo would play one song then request if wanted to move the streaming service to our device.  We would have it and then lose it as my Grandmother at her location did the same thing.  I called Amazon about the problem and spoke with someone with a heavy Indian accent who claimed they could resolve the problem and after 20 minutes dropped the call.  I tried again and got a second Indian representative who was brash, rude, continually talking over me and saying ""just let your 98 year old Grandmother listen to her music!"".  Giving up i tried to politely end the call, where the representative asked if there was anything else he could help with.....  I was hoping i would get a survey about the call, but instead i got an form email from the rep saying it was a pleasure talking with me and he was glad he could help....  No survey.  On the same day this conversation occurred my wife got a charge on her credit card from Amazon for a Prime Membership.  When checking the credit card purchase online i clicked on the merchant who charged her and i was taken to my Amazon Prime Account.....  I did  not purchase a second Prime account and most assuredly not on my wife's credit card.  Well we got that charge cancelled but are still wondering what happened and are living with the competing Echo's.  Yet to be figured out.  The device is very nice....  The Customer Service to help us set it up...  Not so much.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

I keep it in our kitchen and use it daily for music, news and general inquiries. I have also setup some smart switches so I can control lights using voice through Alexa. When I upgraded to smart thermostats I purchased one that has Alexa built in. I noticed recently that the Echo was not interpreting my requests very well and frequently would not play a song after a request. I assumed it was just getting old so decided to upgrade to this latest device that was on sale during Prime days. I assumed there would be a significant improvement in sound quality but it is marginally better. not enough to justify replacement. I find I need to yell at this echo for it to recognize my voice, the old one worked much better. Lastly, I moved my old 2nd gen echo into the upstairs bedroom thinking I could play music up there but Alexa does not support that. Appears you need to have an individual Amazon account for each device if you want to have it play Spotify. I have a Spotify family account and have no interest in paying for Amazon music premium as well. I am disappointed with this and now I have two echoes that are unreliable when it comes to playing any requested music. I am seriously going to look at Google now.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

The bass is insane, to the point where you have to turn it down to hear much of anything else. The midrange is recessed to a nearly objectionable amount, but for the price it's tolerable, I guess.Amazon must do something with spatial audio because the stereo image on these is also insane. Very nice.As for the Alexa thing, I already have four other Alexa eavesdroppers. This is more a review of Echo as an audio device and stereo deal. Short version: don't do it.Linking my two echoes together was easy enough, but one got put in  one ""room"" and one unassigned, and after days I can't for the life of me figure out how to get that other Echo into the same ""room"", but it's just a labeling thing. Connecting them in stereo was simple. Then came the issues.First... these only work in stereo if you stream from an official Amazon(tm) service. That means Amazon music (and probably Prime video). So if you wanted to use these in stereo for TV or YouTube... nope. Doesn't work.And even using this with Amazon Music... is problematic. I have to connect to the pair twice before they start playing, but I can deal with that. But then the Amazon Music app might reset and then I have zero control of what's playing. The speakers keep going on the playlist, somehow, but the app completely loses any sense of what's going on. So seeing what's playing or skipping songs isn't do-able.And as a Zigbee hub... well one works great, but Alexa has no sense of common controls like changing light colors in a group (only individually). It's a great piece of hardware stymied by limited software. There's no reason Alexa couldn't crib notes from every other zigbee app out there, and use my wifi network to stream audio data from one Echo to the others when I bluetooth connect to it. These would make a great little theater setup if they got that to work and kept the sale pricing.Of course, I don't use the thing for Alexa at all, which should probably say something about the strange product planning involved as well. Kudos to the hardware guys, but what is the software group up to?\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

It will only sometimes do my routines that I set up that worked perfectly on my echo dot.

I then asked it again, the device lit up when I asked, but then went dark like it didn't hear me.  I tried yet again and the same happened.

And one fact is true ... amazon has done a very good job with making small improvements while keeping the costs down . This latest design is once again a minor improvement on the previous generations I own . The sound has improved a bit . Slightly more bass and treble . Still not a Sonos or a Bose ... but the cost isn\u2019t either . So it\u2019s a compromise . Glad they finally just included the \u201chub\u201d instead of 2 separate models . The design being a sphere is up for debate . One thing that isn\u2019t ... it\u2019s no longer a omnidirectional speaker . It sends sound where you point it . So unfortunately you can\u2019t bounce the sound off a wall to increase the bass like previous generations  . The look ? Meh ... kinda weird . But not a deal breaker . One complaint I have as well as others : the led indicator that lets you know it\u2019s listening is now on the bottom . Terrible placement . You just can\u2019t ever see it ! If it was higher or if it was much brighter perhaps . 2 things that I\u2019m not happy about at all  : 1) like others have said ... the microphones are no longer as sensitive as other generations . My older echos almost never miss when I ask a question , even clear across the house . This one ? I very often end up screaming at it , especially when the music is playing . Even when I\u2019m just a few feet away. It seems as though there are either less microphones or the ones on this model are not as discerning. Perhaps a software update in the future will improve this . ( note : I am not alone in my evaluation - others are having the same issue) 2)  My biggest dislike ? I purchased 2 black / charcoal echos ... and they give you white power cords with white power blocks ! White ? Seriously ? No doubt this is a cost saving measure so that they include the white ones across the board no matter what you order . But ... they are ugly as Hell ! They do not blend in at all . Hopefully they listen to all of us complaining and change this - as well as swap out our white ones for black ones . Amazon pulled a Henry Ford with the model T .

It might be more accurately described as a love/hate relationship, but at the end of the day, I Adore that spicy bish. I love asking Alexa  strange questions or just throwing out song requests or a reminder or timer throughout my day, I utilize the crap out of her! Alexa answers are hit and miss, I do receive a lot of ""Sorry, I don't know that"" but all in all the idea behind Alexa is sound. I have owned at least 1 Echo and an echo dot (if available) since its inception, and continue to be impressed with the utility of it. This generation of Echo has been a real disappointment to me. While Alexa is becoming more fluid in this iteration,  in some ways it feels like a rather large step back from its predecessors.  Let's talk about this generations audio, shall we? I dislike that when using verbal commands to Alexa for volume up or volume down, it's  very basic and uses a 1-10 system. This can be modified using the plus or minus sign on the device itself, or using the Alexa app on phones (which, to its credit, allows for a 1% to 100% sliding scale to get the desired volume). However, if you are like me and want to be able to say ""Alexa, set volume to 22%"" Alexa will set the volume to the nearest  1-10 volume, in this case, it would set the Echo to volume 2. As an audiophile this feels clunky and lacks ease of use I've come to expect from Echo devices. The sound quality is alright, but I miss the 360 degree sound that previous generations gave me. Fourth generation Echo's also lack music clarity, and the bass is not impressive in the least.Next up, the shape, sigh. This 4th generation Echo looks like a crystal ball and takes up more space while also being a lot more noticeable. Perhaps this is intentional, but I prefer the more discreet shape of the 3rd generation. I am not impressed with them doing collaborations with designers like Diane Von Furstenberg when so many more necessary features like better audio quality and the Echo's voice sensitivity are sorely lacking.

Sometimes Alexa will refuse to play a song unless we upgrade to ""unlimited"" (which we already have), even though she played the song recently.  Then, after we decline the upgrade she will shuffle he song we requested in with similar songs, and then play the similar songs instead of the one requested.We find all of these ""features"" frustrating in the extreme and have felt like smashing the Echo to pieces.Thanks, Amazon the wrecking a peaceful and enjoyable pastime and replacing it with something that raises both blood pressures and tempers more often than not.If your review system allowed 0-star reviews I would have selected it.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I was just about to purchase a new one when they called. I couldn't handle the bad sound it was giving on my favorite songs.  I like that they did that, but still make sure you pay attention to the sound and get more warranty or something. Bought the last one in Sept. of 2021 and it broke by June of 2022.  I had these less than a year. I never raise the volume past 6 most days... over time the sub just stop producing good sound and at some point I'm screaming at it to hear me. I have the bass on 0 and it still have that blown out sound. Like what happened? I'm sure they plan for them to break after a few months so you have to consider buying a new one. My whole house have one in every room or section and I'm thinking about tossing them all out and getting google just because you can whisper to those and they hear you.

The sound quality is there, but it has a lot of trouble answering my questions (I'm a native English speaker), so I get a lot of non-sensical replies. It also seems to have trouble integrating my 2 echos and will play music on the wrong one all the time, which can disturb those on the other room. A friend of mine has a Google smart speaker and has 4 of them set up and does not have this problem. Additionally, I still haven't figured out how to get my Apple playlists to play on this echo. I can request specific music from Apple and it will play it but it won't play playlists. Also, sometimes I have asked Alexa to google a response to a question (Siri can handle this), and she says she is unable to do a google search. . It's been a disappointing experience other than the speaker is really good quality for the price (but so is Google's).

Whoever thought coupling a white power cord with a black-colored product needs to be fired. The first and second BLACK Echo products came with....wait for it.. BLACK power cords. Because if you are buying something in black, it is probably to pair with room decor. So having a very obvious WHITE cable paired with BLACK setting defeats the purpose. Obviously, the product in white coming with a white power cord is a great match; very stupid design choice. It looks like a duckpin bowling ball or a magic eight ball. Very odd. Bought 3 and will keep them since they were half-price. The white looks nice enough but the black only works if you can properly hide the entire cable.

I was able to connect a Philips Hue bulb and it seems to be working well as a hub - it's a nice feature. The temperature sensor seems to be working well. I'm not a fan of the lights being underneath reflecting off the surface. It's more difficult to see them and I miss the large rotating volume knob which is much more intuitive to use. It was impossible to add the new speaker to my existing speaker group - seems to be a bug of some sort with the Alexa app (iOS). I couldn't stream to the device using my Amazom Music app, also seems to be a bug of some sort with the app (iOS).ORIGINAL REVIEW 10/23/2020I was hoping the audio quality of the 4th gen was going to be better than my first gen echo. I listened to them side by side and the don't sound THAT different - not worth the cost of replacement. The new version is louder, has slightly more pronounced bass and fills the room about the same when against the wall. The sound of the new one seems unbalanced. The highs are tinny and overbearing. Mids are understated and the bass is so-so. Overall the sound is top heavy and flat.Its width takes up a lot more space, about double over the first gen. The buttons on top are kind of difficult to press - they're hard to feel without looking, shaped into small symbols instead of chunky round buttons and not that responsive. The original echo's buttons were easier to navigate without looking.I don't mind the white cable because it blends in better with the white walls.If you don't mind having 2 devices, I would suggest going with an echo dot and buying a good quality bluetooth speaker. The flexibility of taking the speaker elsewhere with you and the sound quality will be much better.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Audio is overly boomy. Sidewalk Bridge function is unreliable.,"\nI own both the full size Echo 4th, and the Echo Dot 4th with LED Clock. I purchased two of the full size Echo 4th devices to allow for connectivity for Ring Bridge devices, notably a Ring Mailbox Sensor and a Ring Lighting Motion Sensor, both of which require either a Ring Bridge, or a Sidewalk Bridge device. This Echo device is specifically named as a recommendation. I gave it a shot, and both the mailbox sensor and the motion sensor went offline repeatedly, even when placed just a few inches from the Echo 4th Gen unit. Sometimes they came back online on their own. Sometimes they ran their batteries dead trying. I returned one of the sensors thinking I had a bad one and got the same results. When I bought a dedicated Ring Bridge, all the problems went away. Sidewalk Bridge simply isn't working and isn't reliable.As for the other features, the audio quality when listening to music or just hearing Alexa's voice is very boomy by default. I haven't tried playing with the equalizer, but really, I should be able to get decent quality from default settings.Voice recognition is hit-or-miss if you're not using Alexa as your wake word. It doesn't seem to matter much if you're facing the unit directly when you speak to it or if you're just somewhere in the room. Recognition is about the same either way, for better or worse.The unit itself is HUGE, and the audio is comparable to the Echo Dot 4th Gen, so if you're faced with a choice between the two and don't need Sidewalk, I'd recommend the Echo Dot.Lastly, the surface is covered with cloth, meaning that cleaning it isn't much of an option. I suspect that at some point, mine will look dingy enough from touching the buttons that I'll want to re-wrap it. Or maybe I should do that preemptively.

Reconsider!,"\nLet me start off by saying I have been a LONG time user of the Echo platform, since gen one and have been a proponent of the platform. I have 20+ echo's and even upgraded some of them as time passes so maybe gone through 30. I just ran across an issue that had apparently popped up sometime last summer but just happened to us as well. I have bought all the Echo's in our family and registered them under my name, pretty standard. Up until we switched phones 3 weeks ago, my wife, who is in my household account, was ALWAYS able to go into her Alexa app and set alarms and reminders on any of our Echo's. As of yesterday that no longer is the case. She can only set alarms or reminders for her phone.I spent 2+ hours texting with 5 people in tech support, got so frustrated that I asked to be connected in person on a call. Talked to two more tech support people on the phone as well. They are telling(insisting) me that only the person who has the Echo registered to their name can set alarms or reminders on those Echo's. So if you have three kids with phones, they can no longer set alarms on any echo device. You can do it verbally still of course. But now if they want an alarm/reminder set in their room they have to walk up the stairs and verbally set it. How does this make ANY sense that only one person in a household can access the alarm/reminders on their mobile devices!?! Takes away half of our functionality!The funny thing is, every one of those techs said that is how it is supposed to work, even though for the last 4+ years my wife has been able to set her own alarms and reminders for our kids. THIS TAKES AWAY HALF THE FUNCTIONALITY OF ECHO'S(if you have a family). That is how she set our kids alarms all through COVID. After a quick google search I found several AMAZON FORUM posts going back a year that this has been happening to other people as well. Just google 'Unable to view or set alarms on Household devices' and you can read for yourself. I screenshotted them as I suspect they will somehow disappear.I think something might be changing at Amazon with the Echo platform and they are slowly taking away this functionality as peoples accounts change or something. I can't make rhyme or reason of it that more people haven't brought this up though. But based on the silly Amazon rep responses and the consistent denial that this was a viable function from multiple Amazon tech's, Amazon appears to have no reason to try and fix this. I suspect they may be rolling out some sort of paid service for Echo's soon. How much money did Bezos lose until Amazon became ubiquitous with everyone was ordering online? He did just recently run up in the annual fee, etc.  Get them a taste or two for free then get them hooked. He is playing the long game for sure. Just my conspiracy theory.Anyways, I will definitely be sending back the other Echo's and thermostats I just bought and may look at switching over to google's devices. Thankfully all my home switches are compatible. Just beware, Echo is no longer nearly as useful for families(or households) anymore and you may want to avoid.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

My phone, TV, and I think it must be my rug or something, already knows even what I'm thinking about.Anyway, I was hoping it could change my TV channels at least, but that involved buying another gizmo. OH --""PREMIUM SOUND"". Not sure what that means but it isn't hifi Bose quality. More like enhance AM radio.That voice ... annoying, so I changed it. It says you can change the voice, but its only male of female. And they say you can change the wake up name. There are only a couple that you can choose from a list as well. All with multiple syllables, and I want a one syllable name..like JOE... Hey Joe. So it stays Alexa with a male voice.I love the shape and look, and with the added light at the base, it looks pretty cool. It would be even better if the entire globe radiated soft pastel colors and then jumped bright red when someone is detected at the front video doorbell You could keep the yellow for when a package is delivered by Amazon.THe jokes are pretty corny. The weather report is great, and it can tell you what temperature is residing at its location. Overall use for TV is great if you have a Fire TV. It wants to go to Fire TV over ROKU or even cable. Changing cable using the Fire TV Blaster is a bit hit or miss. It doesn't respond the same to even the same command to change the channel. Overall using Alexa to control the TV is hit or miss anyway. Much easier to just use the remote.My overall assessment is that it's a cool gimmick, not really practical. That might be me though, as I'm old. A longtime tech-head, but an old one.

Once it loaded the skill and found the vacuum it said all was go. ""Ask Wyze to clean"" So I did and it said ""there was a problem."" and NOTHING ELSE? Again, more trouble than it's worth!

Makes me long for my Gen1 Echo.,"\nUpdate: 28 Jan 2022I've really had it with this thing; it's a hot, steaming pile.  I recently went through a phase where the ring would light yellow, letting me know that there were new notifications waiting.  I'd say, ""Alexa, read my notifications,"" and the Echo would tell me that I had no notifications.  Asking a second time would usually result in success.  Then this morning, the Echo decided to shout to the world that we'd added breakfast sandwiches to our shopping list.  Mind you, I NEVER touch the volume controls -- on the device or on the app -- except to reset them when the Echo decides to shout at me.  This morning it shouted so loud that it woke two of my children on ANOTHER FLOOR.  I'm done with this piece of junk.  It's now packed away in my basement, and I've brought my Gen1 back online.----------I was an early and aggressive adopter of Echo products over the years.  I bought my Gen1 Echo during the pre-release phase, have had several Dots, and now have several Shows as bedroom alarm clocks.  So when I bought my Gen4 Echo to replace my original Gen1, I did so with great expectations.  Let me tell you how disappointed I am.The first thing I noticed was that when paired to my iPad (which sits right next to the Echo on my kitchen island), the audio frequently crackles and drops.  This was never an issue with my Gen1, and the behavior has persisted across pairing to my iPhone and two different iPads.  That makes me pretty confident that the issue is in the Echo, and not in the attached devices.The next major issue is with volume control on the Gen4.  I still haven\u2019t figured it out.  I have tried the on-device controls and the Volume and Sound settings in the Alexa app, but there seems to be no logic to what volume the Echo responds to me.  I can ask Alexa for a weather report and all is fine, then a few seconds later ask Alexa to add something to my shopping list, only to hear the Echo shout the response.  The Echo will announce a reminder softly, and then boom my notifications when I ask.  Adjusting and re-adjusting the Volume and Sound settings in the Alexa app solves the problem temporarily, but the issue resumes not long after.More recently, the Echo has started playing music after announcing reminders or playing announcements.  It wasn\u2019t playing music before, and no one asked it to start playing music; it just does it on its own.  (This behavior was kind of funny the first few times, but now I\u2019m getting tired of telling the Echo to stop playing music after it tells me to take out the trash or clean the guinea pig cage\u2026)And then there\u2019s the \u201cspinning blue ring issue\u201d that seems to have cropped up recently.  Frequently over the last few days, I\u2019ve caught the Echo with the light ring illuminated blue, with a slightly brighter blue indicator spinning round and round.  It will do this for minutes at a time, stop, and then just start doing it again later.  During this time, the device is non-responsive.I never saw these issues with the Gen1, nor do my Shows seem to have so many issues.  But I\u2019m thoroughly disappointed with the Gen4.  It truly makes me wish I had my Gen1 back.  My opinion:  Save your money and avoid this one.  Maybe the Gen5 will be better.\n",11 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

My review on the 3rd generation keeps getting deleted under the claim that it has been determined that I received a genuine product, and therefore my review has been deleted. I made it clear that changes to Prime Music (thanks to a failing Alexa department) causes dissatisfaction with the product and certainly not a claim of a fake or poor device. I guess people like me are not happy with their purchase of Echo devices, thanks to the changes to Prime Music, and Amazon is trying to stop the impact on their Echo devices, but when the two are linked, exactly what do they expect!I wish there was a way to get my money back. My entire family loved Amazon Music, and we purchased numerous Echo products as a result. Many hours of homework spent with the Echo devices as well as the app in the car, at home and school. Our recommendations meant other people purchased Echo products as well. However, the most recent update to Prime Music means a poor imitation of Spotify!I instantly knew there was trouble when Amazon sent a ""marketing"" email in an attempt to convince us that the changes were an improvement to the service when it really is not. My children very quickly uninstalled the Prime Music app (their Echos are now used exclusively as light switches and alarm clocks--just crazy) and now use YouTube Music for playing the music they want to listen to. I have just done the same off all my devices. Amazon claims there is more variety as there is apparently more song content available, but anyone who has enjoyed Prime Music before, instantly notices that a loss in control of content masquerades as a claim of variety.I am now trying to decide between throwing my useless Alexa devices away, or finding someone willing to pay for Unlimited to take the devices off my hands.What no longer works that has caused me to class the Echo devices as useless, even as it now prompts for an upgrade?1. Downloaded songs no longer play on the app2. Can't thumbs down a song3. Can't repeat a song4. Can't skip more than 5 of the songs Amazon forces me to listen to5. Can't play our playlists (starts with the first song, but then switches to playing random, similar music to the first song only and not the songs on the actual playlist. If you request a playlist, the response says, ""playing x playlist and other similar songs."" Cannot play a diverse list of genres, just what is similar to the first song, I mean really, a radio plays more diversity).0 stars for a previous 5 star device because of changes to Prime Music!\n",One person found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I also have purchased several Echo Dots in that time.  I like how each sounds but I have to admit the Echo 1st Gen with hub sounds great, much better than the Dots.  I didn't and don't have a problem with it, it still sounds great and responds great.  It sounds so great I had been planning on getting a second one to go in another room for some time.  So since I kept seeing the new 4th Gen Echo advertised for around $70 I couldn't pass it up.  I read the reviews about having to repeat ""Alexa"" being an issue but I didn't realize how bad it would be until I ran into the problem myself.  I have it in my bedroom on my nightstand and you would think that no matter what position you are in it would hear you when you are lying on the bed with the speaker about a foot away.  But that's not the case, if you are facing away from the speaker you almost have to yell ""Alexa"", so that your sound bounces off one of the walls, to get a response.  And this is the case no matter where you are in the room.  You have to face the speaker to get a constant response.  I don't have that problem with the 1st Gen speaker.  If it only had only happened a couple of times I wouldn't care, but it's constant.But not all is bad about the speaker.  I know that some of the reviews mentioned about it's tone being a little too low.  I actually like the sound it puts out.  This is far better than my 1st Gen and the Dots.  After all the ranting about having to repeat my demands, the sound, at least for me, does make up for it and I do plan on buying another one to get a more stereo effect.I still don't think that it warrants four or five stars because it is a smart speaker, and if previous generations function better at performing that function, there is definitely room for improvement for this gen.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

The mics on the Echo plus were a little sluggish so I thought why not upgrade and move my echo plus to another part of the house that is less used.  Well the new Echo showed up a little early and I even went through the payment plan.  I thought that the new generation should have all kinds of woops and whistles than what I originally had.Well the first thing that I enjoyed was the integration of dual languages.  With me learning Spanish this I thought would be a fun feature.  Well it seams that this version has still a lot of issues.  My commands are not recognized very often.  When I try to play something from xm it just errors.  I have to use my echo show to play on the network I choose.  Now it plays fine on the new Echo but it just does not seem to take commands very well.  The spanish commands are hit and miss but right on with the echo show.Overall I am very disappointed with the replacement.  If it wasn't for my smart home features I may even consider sending it back till they can get it right.  The first and second gen plus is still very cheap and I could just replace it with that from ebay or something.(update)  So tech support reached out to me and was concerned as well.  It seems that my Echo Show is less sensitive to commands than the echo plus.  The echo plus being more sensitive, would not know how to respond if there was an extra word in the command.  As for the Language issue well it worked fine the first time the tech was listening but the second time it would not respond saying it had a limited vocab.  They will work on it.  Because they were so nice about it I told them I would update my original review to include their exceptional service.\n",,

I have become increasingly frustrated with it's inability to hear me.  Sometimes I have to yell so loud that the bedroom Echo responds instead of the one in the family room.  I'm seriously considering returning this one and using my old gen 1 Echo.  Either Amazon needs to improve the sensitivity or give us the ability to adjust it ourselves.I bought this to replace a gen 1 tower.  I have several echo devices around the house and liked the old cylinder.  I won\u2019t comment on the aesthetics since that is a personal preference, but will say the new design requires a larger footprint on the table.  The base is small, but the diameter of the sphere means you can\u2019t put anything close to the bottom of the base.  Functionally, the sound quality is much better than the gen 1 device.  I appreciate that the new design probably was necessary for that.  The new echo is much more directional.  This is good if you have it against a wall, but not if it is in the middle of the room.  The light ring at the base makes it difficult to see on a low table or if there is something on the table next to it (like a book).  I have a lot of trouble seeing if Alexa heard me.  Speaking of that...it seems Alexa is aging and has a lot more trouble hearing me than the old one did.  I find I have to talk loudly to be heard and with the light ring at the bottom, I have to be in the right position to see if she\u2019s responding.  The built in hub was a bonus.  I have a hub from years ago, so have not made use of it yet, but will eventually try to retire the hub I have.  I like the new device, but will not be replacing any of my gen 3 dots with the new dots.  I wish they still sold the gen 3s with the clock.  I\u2019ll wait for the next revision and see how I feel about those.\n",6 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

At home I use smart things with echo dots all over and it works great when our echos aren\u2019t deaf or, now suddenly, trying to advertise crap after being given a conmand (if you\u2019re reading this Amazon I\u2019m about to rip every Amazon device out because of that bs).At my office though I just needed a small amount of devices to control and make a few automations with and I thought this would kill 2 birds with one stone. Man was I wrong.My first complaint is everything after two days shows up as unresponsive. It still works with voice commands or in the app but you constantly have the darn thing chiming back at you to say \u201ctable warmer is unavailable please check the Alexa app or this device is offline please check the Alexa app for further information\u201d and you can\u2019t make it stop. Considering I\u2019m using it in my massage studio this is beyond annoying when it blurts that out while Al client is already on the table.Routines suck too. You cannot use more than one sensor in a routine.  I wanted it to do certain things like it the door sensor opens and you detect motion turn on this this and this. No.  You can only use one either the door or the motion but not both. This hub has been out for 5 years how is it still this basic?Want to see the history of your sensors? Tough s***. You cannot see a log (at least I cannot find where and I\u2019ve looked) of the sensor.  Did someone come into my office when I wasn\u2019t there? Who the heck knows because I can\u2019t see the log.  The guard thing is annoying. I just wanted what I thought was basic smart home stuff. What I got was the kindergarten version of a smart home hub.Amazon you are FAILING miserably between the Alexa advertisements and interruptions and the smart home hub. Like I mentioned earlier I\u2019m about to rip every Amazon assistant from my home and find something better if they don\u2019t fix it. If I ask for the weather that\u2019s all I want. I don\u2019t want you rambling on about a new skill I can buy or something else you can do. Just do what is ask and stop. But no it\u2019s all about money.I used to love these things now I just find myself yelling at them because they go deaf and can\u2019t turn on a simple light or telling it to shut up because it goes off the rails.  I have one dot in the living room that can hear EVERYTHING, I have the same versions in each room and that one dot almost never misses a beat when I ask it to do something even in other rooms. The others I can be standing two feet from and it can\u2019t hear a truck plowing through the house to save it. In total I have 6 new dots at home and this 1 plus at work.

After they rang, I set another 30-minute timer (I know I nap quite a bit). However, after the new timer is set, the old timer kept ringing. So I said to Alexa with my dreamy eyes, ""Alexa, turn off the alarm"" to which Alexa replied, ""there is no active alarm.""Thinking that the 30-minute timer is canceled too, I told Alexa again, ""Alexa, set a timer for 30 minutes."" It replied, ""Second alarm set for 30 minutes."" Frustrated, I then told Alexa to clear all timers and set just 1 alarm for 30 minutes, to which it replied, ""Third alarm set for 30 minutes.""Not wanting three alarms to go off one after another, I asked Alexa to clear all timers. Alexa then read to me, that I have 3 active timers set, with the FIRST timer set to 30 minutes and X minutes X seconds remaining, the SECOND timer set to 30 minutes X minutes X seconds remaining, the THIRD timer set to 30 minutes and X minutes X seconds remaining, which one did I want to cancel. I said ""all of them."" Alexa then said ""timer all of them"" was not found and then hung up on me. I then had to tell it to cancel my timers again. It repeated the same information about each of the timers, which took a very long minute, and then proceeded to ask me which timer I wanted to cancel again. ""You have a 30-minute timer with 23 minutes and 40 seconds left, a 30-minute timer with 25 minutes and 12 seconds left, and a 30-minute timer with 26 minutes and 23 seconds left. Which timer would you like to cancel?""""The 30-minute timer."" I replied.""Fourth timer, 30 minutes, starting now.""----------------------------------------------------------------Although I have now figured out that I needed to say to Alexa ""clear all timers,"" frustrations like these and all the unwanted advertising are still making me want to just donate Alexa to charity.

What little usefulness it has is just a hook to make you pay for and become reliant on amazon music unlimited. Unless you swallow that bait it is a poor and inconvenient option. Even if you can find enough \u201cfree with Prime\u201d music that you want to listen to, it won\u2019t let you add more than 20 songs to a playlist. Any function that doesn\u2019t further Amazon\u2019s ability to sell you more stuff or subscribe to more stuff, is just ignored and unaddressed.\u201cWhole House Audio\u201d??? That\u2019s a joke. It won\u2019t let you play your own music from your phone on the \u201ceverywhere group\u201d. It won\u2019t let you play radio apps on the \u201ceverywhere group\u201d. It won\u2019t let you play audio books on the \u201ceverywhere group\u201d. It won\u2019t let you play the audio from a Bluetooth-connected TV on the \u201ceverywhere group\u201d. Basically it\u2019s a novelty item that is WAY oversold as a whole house audio solution. It is only \u201cwhole house audio\u201d for being tied to Amazon\u2019s pay streaming music.If music is playing on one unit, and you ask it to continue playing the music on the \u201ceverywhere group\u201d: First, it will tell you that you can\u2019t play music on the \u201ceverywhere group\u201d because music is already playing on another unit. But It\u2019s not playing on another unit. It is playing on the unit you are talking to. So it will force you to stop playing the music and then make a new music request to be played on the everywhere group. I have yet to be able to get it to continue playing the same music it was originally playing on the everywhere group. Continuity is awful (non-existent). Amazon is primarily concerned with selling you the unlimited subscription, instead of responding to a reasonably foreseeable request in a manner that enhances your listening continuity as you move around the house.Let\u2019s say you\u2019re getting ready in the morning and you want Alexa to tell you the news. Don\u2019t expect to able to move around from room to room because it will only play that news audio on one unit. Not on the everywhere group, or on another smaller group. If you move to a different room that has  another unit, your only option is to replay the news from the very beginning again and listen to what you have listened to already over again.None of these problems are beyond the technical ability of the Echo units. Some of the problems are intentionally created obstacles just to try to force you into paying for unlimited. Others problems remain unaddressed because they wouldn\u2019t help (or hurt) Amazon to sell you more \u201cstuff\u201d.So you\u2019ve spent a few hundred dollars on echo units for around your house? Good luck with that. Don\u2019t expect true whole house audio and don\u2019t expect them to work together as a group of units. All you did was purchase the \u201cgateway drug\u201d for Amazon\u2019s selling machine.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

The AI seems weak and always interested in sending us to some subscription site. The weight of the plug causes the plug to fall out of the wall socket. I assume it's Alexa trying to avoid having to deal with us :) The speaker quality is decent, but not really outstanding. It can get loud, but the bass is dull IMHO and muffles clarity at times.Anyway, if you like shouting commands at someone repeatedly (maybe you're a drill sergeant or unhappily married), then this might be a diverting toy for you. More seriously, though, if you have restricted mobility or you live alone, then this device could be a real time/effort saver if you have it hooked up to other devices in your home (e.g., lights, tv, wall thermometer). You should be aware that there is a trade off between your privacy and the detail of your personal experience. For example, Alexa will want access to your contacts if you use it for calling folks via your wifi (your internet connection). And, it wasn't so long ago that people were able to hear others' conversations and command history. BTW: This is information you can look up via your Amazon account. So, travel with caution and ask yourself whether voice commands are superior to the discretion of silently typing your searches (which are archived is a cloud unless you disable the feature). I'll update this review once I've had more experience with the device, but right now, it seems that an Apple iPad does pretty much the same things (with Siri) and video availability (though at a much greater cost).\n",879 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I also prefer the 360\xb0 sound from the echo plus. after going back-and-forth I\u2019ve personally experienced the microphones on the echo plus pick up my voice better. in my opinion this new version just sounds a little bit louder with more bass even though they both have the exact same drivers with the exception of the new one having an extra tweeter which doesn\u2019t really make a difference in the sound. I actually had to turn down the bass just a little because it sounded a little... messy. i\u2019m not really sure why they completely changed the design and got rid of the 360\xb0 sound and made it a directional sound speaker instead. i\u2019m a little confused. One more thing I noticed about the new speaker is when the volume goes up the bass goes down which is very common for all these speakers and most Bluetooth speakers but it seems especially evident in this newest version of the echo. they could\u2019ve at least made the bluetooth option volume sync with your phone with this new version. and of course it wasn\u2019t compatible to pair with my echo plus for stereo. ok i\u2019m done.\n,One person found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

The 4th gen Echo is more than capable of shaking the entire bookshelf she\u2019s on with just the default audio settings.However, there is one extremely frustrating aspect to the 4th gen echo, coming from a 1st gen: microphone quality and her ability to recognize when she is being spoken to.My 1st gen echo was almost too sensitive. She would wake up for anything that even vaguely sounded like \u201cAlexa\u201d at any volume with close to any amount of room noise. I have an oscillating fan in my living room and she could hear me over that and the TV. The new 4th gen will basically refuse to hear me unless I turn the fan off and mute the TV. And when she does recognize that I\u2019m yelling ALEXA at her from 10 feet away, half the time she won\u2019t pick up on the command I speak next.

She is not capable of answering almost any question, including her own model or specifications. And after a dozen tries, she still could not connect to my device. Alexa used to be far simpler, far less expensive, and work far better.Is it time to convert to Google smart home, or is that just as bad?Addition: After posting this review, Amazon Customer Service called me and was able to assist me in connecting this Echo to my devices. I have added two stars to reflect that service.I remain disappointed that I had to buy two new Echoes and devices to connect to them merely because Comcast replaced my router with a newer model. And it is still the case that this Echo provides less assistance than the older models I had.  Also, having lived with it for a few days, I have noticed that the sound quality is worse than the older models, even though it looks like it has a bigger speaker.\n",3 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

We have a total of 12 Echos, Echo Shows, & Echo Dots placed throughout our home and these are the worst when it comes to communication. 2 of them replaced Echo 3rd Gens, and another was an add on to an existing TV (with 4k firestick) for better sound and since adding them to our system, we have had nothing but problems with the wrong device answering us. None of the locations changed, these were just swapped in. We noticed that these ALL LAG, and must not have the same speaker configuration as the Echo 3rd Gens because Echos two rooms away will now answer before these devices will.They do sound GREAT when they work properly, but because we already had a functioning system throughout our house, and knew the capabilities, these were/are a HUGE let down.I have tried updating them to see if that helps, but it has not.As a stand alone device these might be great, but to a family that has been using Alexas since the beginning and keeps adding for functionality around the home, we find them more of a nuisance than a help. We end up yelling at poor Alexa more than it's worth.I will note also, one is being used and is hard wired into my work from home computer, and that one lags even more... I notice when I unplug the AUX cable it seems to pick up speed, but when it is plugged in via the AUX cable to my PC it lags and is very slow to respond which in turn has the wrong device answering most times.It has all become more frustrating than helpful.

Voice recognition is a 50/50 toss-up, and while it's better at accurately recognizing words and phrases than other AI assistants, it still misses enough that important information doesn't get added to your to-do list or shopping list.I use it the most for timers, calendar reminders, task reminders, and adding things to my to-do list and shopping list hands off. Timers and task reminders work great; calendar reminders are awesome, but for some reason everything gets repeated twice even after having it set in the app to only repeat reminders once. The to-do list and shopping list feature works, but the integrations between different apps are really poor (my to-do list lets me have a dumping ground list for tasks added through the Alexa, but I have to manually sort and tag them later), and the Alexa app's features aren't strong enough that I'd be comfortable switching my lists to its platform for the ease of integration.We have two smart lights from Geeni that we use with it, and every second or third time we try to operate them through voice commands, the command fails in some way - the Echo doesn't respond even after listening to your request, or it says ""okay"" but doesn't actually operate the light until a few minutes or few tries later.We tried connecting it to our Firestick, but it was so non-functional we had a better experience just keeping them separate. HBO would routinely crash, or the sound would cut off of HBO streams, when the Echo was the speaker for the firestick; and the process of re-connecting the Echo after this happens, and clearing the Firestick app cache and relaunching things, etc. made the process miserable and unworkable.The app is very slow and hard to navigate - the paths to different features are hard to find, and you have to retrace your steps a lot to complete multiple complex actions.The audio quality is excellent, and I love using it for sleep ambience and music. However, it's very annoying to have to hear ads interfering with the experience of virtually any Alexa app you'll use, whether that's a small soundscape service or a major music platform. The best experience I have is connecting it to my phone via Bluetooth so I can play whatever I want without interruption, which is a pain, but at least then I haven't just paid for an Amazon product that still makes me listen to ads.Also, the fact that staff will have to listen to voice recordings to improve the quality of the products or that your speech is stored in the cloud at all is a huge privacy issue.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

Amazon Sells This to Convert People to Their Music Streaming Service!,"\nDo not buy this if you are using it with Apple Music. I'm confident it's a piece of garbage for Spotify users too. Echo is advertised to work with Apple Music. But you can only use Apple Music in specific ways.You cannot access your library! The only way to access songs in your library is by creating your own playlist. And that still does not give you access to a play a song in that playlist. You have to skip through the playlist to find the desired song. It doesn't let you play Recently Played or Recently Added either.You cannot tell Echo to play a song or an album you want to listen to! You cannot select songs or albums on your phone either. The app is bad in other ways. I wish I could just connect to bluetooth and use the Apple Music or Spotify app on my phone (like any other bluetooth speaker).DELAY is very long when using the app! Earlier today I pressed the skip button on my phone to change songs. I was able to have a short conversation with someone before the command was processed (or the song actually changed). No exaggeration. Usually the delay is shorter, but still about 5 seconds. That's still unacceptable and frustrating. You cannot skip songs without wasting lots of time.You can only tell Alexa to start the playlist, shuffle, and skip songs (waiting several seconds or sometimes minutes between songs).Volume buttons on my iPhone do not work while using Echo. I have to scroll the volume tab on the app, or use my voice to tell Alexa to quiet down. And, like switching songs, there is a LONG DELAY when you adjust volume! I found myself accidentally playing music way too loud and having to just deal with the pain and discomfort for several seconds. You cannot quickly adjust the volume!I have not been this disappointed and frustrated with a product. I am convinced this is Amazon's way of making people switch from Apple Music or Spotify to their music service. It probably works well with their streaming service. That must be why Echo is priced reasonably.Sound quality is ok for the price. It's louder than I expected. However, bass heavy music like Rap sounds distorted and generally poor. It is advertised as having ""deep bass."" Bass is really disappointing with this, even considering it's a small and affordable speaker. My smaller, lighter, wireless JBL speaker has more bass. The Echo gets much louder (with no bass).Alexa is sometimes bad at understanding commands. I said earlier, ""Alexa, play Recently Played playlist on Apple Music."" (I know this command cannot be done with the Echo.) However, instead of telling me this cannot be done, Alexa played some Apple Curated playlist that had nothing to do with my command. Music played that I don't like and I could not pause it for 5-10 seconds.All that being said, you'll be disappointed with this product. Disappointed is not a strong enough word through. This thing is intentionally designed by Amazon to frustrate people that use Apple Music and Spotify. I understand that Amazon is motivated by profit. However, profit should not come at the expense of making customers angry. This Echo was clearly built to make people so frustrated, so they switch to Amazon's music service. The majority of people use Apple Music and Spotify. They intentionally prohibit the most BASIC features so that you pay them instead of Apple or Spotify! I feel disrespected by Amazon.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I've been contacted by Amazon Outreach Support for comments on my review.  They offered to replace the unit with a refurbished one, but I did not want one that someone else returned for possibly the same reason.The 4th gen has 4 microphones where as the 2nd gen I traded in had 7 microphones.  Why the reduction in microphones?  With my bedroom door open I can yell to my bedroom Echo, with out a response,  and I can hear the 2nd gen Echo downstairs in the living room respond.  It is actually comical at this point.  I no longer have to snooze the alarm since I fully wake up trying to get it to respond.  Something is definitely wrong with this design and lack of microphones.  I've been watching and waiting to see if an updated version is coming out, but still nothing.  Huge disappointment for a great device.We have a total of 7 Echo speakers in the house range from the cube to the dot, varying generations.  By far this is the best sounding, but it is also deaf at the same time.  I dabbled with the idea of replacing my home entertainment speakers with either 2 of these 4th gen and the sub-woofer or an Echo Studio and the sub-woofer, but none have been updated in years.  2020 for the 4th gen and 2019 for the Studio.

If you want a device that will actually do what it is supposed to without randomly just forgetting how to do things it was doing literally minutes before, don't waste your money on an Echo.I purchased the Echo to act as a room thermometer since I live in a state that does not feel that central heat and air is worth providing to peasants in apartments. Worked great out of the box, so I got a bunch of the light bulbs to go with it expecting that I was about to start setting up my smart home for the future. Within a few days most of the light blubs no longer responded to voice commands, or did respond but Alexa would tell me that it is not responding. Annoying, but as it was not the thing I bought this for, it was simply an annoyance.Then the thermometer stopped working. Rather than tell me there is an issue, or provide any semblance of help, Alexa just says this feature is not supported. Well, that of course is simply not correct, but Alexa will not help you with things, she simply is a robot voice with no ability to problem solve or even perform the most basic error checking that even Windows is finally good at. So there is no arguing with her, when she says it is not supported, boom, it simply does not work anymore.So I went through the hassle of trying to figure out how to get it working again. Finally found that by removing all of the groups and lights I had added and then reset the device, the one thing I bought it for will actually work again. Great! I cant use any of the other features it has or it will kill the thermometer, but hey $50 for a thermometer is a steal. Wait... indoor thermometers are way cheaper than that. Well shoot.I then got home this evening to find that even though I have none of the other features activated, the thermometer is again ""not supported"". I work in tech support so I understand that things will not always work right out of the box, and that is reasonable. For them to randomly break with no input from the user is just a sign of a poorly made and designed product. Honestly, Bezos has all of the money now so trying to provide feedback to Amazon at this point is useless. If you have never gotten to experience their customer service, try it sometime. It is eye opening. So rather than write them a long message they will never read, it is easier to just let all of yall know what to expect.It might work, it might not, but if it doesn't you are up the proverbial creek without a paddle.

The globe shape takes up more space in every instance where it's put than its cylindrical predecessors2.  The internal temperature sensor is often inaccurate.  Apparently it updates no more often than every 30 minutes.3.  The buggy alexa app occasionally shows the echo 4 temperature on its status screen, but most of the time it doesn't display -- the temperature line is missing. Previous versions prominently displayed the temperature.4.  The temperature measures in C despite setting it to F in the alexa app.  The only way to change it is through a voice command to the echo.5.  Sound quality is markedly worse -- and is especially directional. Vocals are muffled and no amount of adjustment makes much difference.6.  The ""equalizer"" is still profoundly primitive with only three adjustment -- bass (which is already too heavy even at the lowest setting); midrange; and treble.7.  No digital signal processing?  This is 2021, not 2001.8.  The on-board processor(s) are very slow to react to commands -- and it's not related to the internet or WiFi.9.  Room speaker groups don't work -- one of the three speakers in the group will work fine and any of the three will work fine, but when asked to play in a group, two of the three speakers behave as if they have poor connections with glitchy sound that then drops in and out.  All are on the same WiFi dedicated network, and I've reset them multiple times.10.  The action light ring on the bottom is hard to see and is largely hidden by the globular shape.  The action ring is on in my image with a waiting notification -- can you see it?  Me neither.11.  There is some sort of sound-based occupancy sensor in this version of the echo -- again, doesn't work reliably, poorly documented; and poorly implemented and integrated with the buggy alexa app.12.  Still no way to interact with the echo devices using a web browser -- forced to use the buggy app.13.  Volume normalization across feeds is abominable.  Some sources, BBC World Service, for example are quiet -- others, such as the NPR feed are loud.  This should be tested before feeds are allowed to go live.  Even better, sound normalization should be automated in the cloud if not on the device.  It's maddening to be required to manually adjust the volume on EVERY SINGLE source!To say I am disappointed in these $100 duds is an understatement.I will be returning these ASAP.\n",4 people found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

This makes it feel more like a diy tinkering toy and less like a premium product.My device still plays music from routines so I know it is connected to the internet so this is just an Amazon issue. Very disappointing. I wish I had stuck with google or tried apple\u2019s offering instead.Another issue I\u2019ve found, this device consistently asks me if I want to hear about products. I want my smart home device to control my smart home, not shove marketing down my throat.Updated 2x: the device has not given me any more issues. The mic is so sensitive it hears commands coming from downstairs or even when I whisper the A word. The sound quality is muddy but becomes \u201cnormal\u201d when you turn down the bass setting as low as possible. This makes the device sound very good. This is a great upgrade over a dot to the point where I actually enjoy listening to music on it.If you want an alexa device and don\u2019t want to spend $200 for the studio this is the one to get.I only wish they added that light up clock on this one, then It would be perfect for me.Updated: last time I unplugged and plugged back in this device seemed to do the trick fixing the microphone sensitivity for the last week.We will see how long it lasts before I need to do this againI needed to upgrade because the echo 1 I was using had an issue where the speaker would short out so you had to unplug it and plug it back in to get the sound to work.In terms of sound and voice recognition this device is not a huge upgrade compared to the first gen echo.This device is just as good as the original with some added features like a thermometer and sonic detection and a 3.5mm out/in so you can use it as a speaker or use other speakers with it.Why this device gets 1 star is for some reason when the device has been plugged in for awhile it will stop hearing the wake word. I am unsure if it is a power saving setting or a wifi setting but the device just does not listen. The only way to fix it is to unplug and plug the device back in.This was the main reason I needed a new device in the first place so you can see how satisfied I am with the new echo.Will update the review if they fix it, until then I\u2019ll keep using my google home mini instead\n",One person found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Do they make hearing aids for Alexa?,"\nUpdate November 2021: I have taken this echo out of service. Last night I ask her to play Klove radio station for me. She said I needed to get Amazons music service.  Told her to stop and tried again. She wanted to play Christmas music.  Told her to stop. Ask her what the temperature would be and she started to play Christmas music. Took her out of service. Ask my echo show to play klove for 30 minutes. Her answer was ""playing klove fromm H..... I heart radio for 30 minutes.""I think Amazon had different clouds for different echos. I have my dots be down but my show5 works fine. My dots don't argue we me like this echo does and this on is always trying to get me to buy things, a lot more than dots and shows does.Original post: I have echos from the very first one to now including echo show 5.  The sound quality is the best of all.  This new one (4th generation) has problem of hearing you and understanding you. I almost have to yell to get her to hear me and then she doesn't understand. Example. I have lights with wifi bulbs (2 different brands)  I almost always have to tell her twice to turn on or off. I have a Amazon smart plug and the same.  easy to set up and easy to get other products to work with her.Update:  I\u2019ve changed my post from 3 Stars to 1. She\u2019s getting more hard of hearing. She went bonkers the other night and could only do a few commands. She kept telling me that she could not connect to the internet. All others were okay. I finally unplugged her then restarted. She then told me she needed to recalibrate. That\u2019s a new one.Update: less than a hour after posting the update Amazon customer services called and worked through the problem. The wakeup name Alexa is a corrupted file. Changing to echo made it better.  We will see if that holds. Change from 3 stars to one. Will move It to 2 stars. If it holds i will change ratings to 3 or higher.UPDATE September 30 2021:I\u2019m going to go back to one star. Her hearing problem is getting worse. She now argues with me. I tell her to turn on plug for porch and she gives ne the definition of a porch. I must tell her two times to turn on porch. She then tells me the porch is not a command. Go to another echo same command and porch comes on.I\u2019ve decided to remove her and put in my old first generation puck in her place. It\u2019s does not miss a command.After reading all the reviews about her hard of hearing I ordered anyway. My advice is don\u2019t buy this one.For information the command to turn on porch was at 4:00 am nothing was on in room to distract her. And had to give command twice and hear what a porch was.\n",5 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

And updated again.","\nThe speaker works well in a large room and we like the looks and color (blue), even though the cord is white. However, the Alexa apt is frustrating and has been since my first Echo Dot (original generation). Then, there's the Amazon Music Unlimited, which you would think would work great with the Amazon Alexa AND the Amazon Echo speakers. Well, I don't know which to blame, but here is an example: I paired my new 4th Generation Echo with my existing 1st gen. Echo Dot (in another room via the Alexa apt), then requested  an artist playlist (i.e. ""play music by Neil Diamond"") and they both worked - for a while. Then, after about six hours (which included Christmas music in March) the gen 4 Echo (mid-song) shut off while the old Echo Dot kept playing. Trying to correct the situation means: Stop Alexa, wait a while, then start over, if you're still inclined. This happens All the time when leaving on long enough. The sound volume also varies song-to-song so that I frequently manually turn the sound up or down. The sound quality is surprisingly good, otherwise. Alexa voice recognition, even after a substantial break-in period is ify: sometimes when requesting a playlist or song Alexa will want to sell me a book.Some artists play for hours and some for an hour, even though they have many more songs to their credit (i.e. Bill Medley played for one hour with three repeats of ""The Time of Our Lives""). If you have a lot of patience, have fun, but, sooner-or-later things get frustrating.Update: After contacting Amazon, a very helpful customer rep. guided me through a Factory Reset. Afterwards she promised the device would work 'perfectly'. It works worse. Now about tree hours both 4th Gen. Echo's hiss during playback then shut down with my original 1st Gen. Echo Dot still playing (on my 'everywhere' group inside our house). Then it took 6-7 attempts to get my old Echo Dot to stop. Before I purchased the two 4th Gen. Echo's, everything worked fine .. not 'perfectly', but fine. Good Luck! IF you buy these .. Still not sure if the problem is the new Echo's or Amazon Music Unlimited. Another update (4-20-21): While we do enjoy Amazon Music (when it works) and the sound is good .. the Echo is in a large room so I decided to add another for stereo and coverage .. call me stupid for still hoping for a good experience .. what convinced me to buy another (?) .. Amazon put it on sale and promised to include a free smart plug .. well, Amazon came through again and didn't include the smart plug and their customer service can't remedy. At least I got the sale price, but, I am increasingly NOT becoming a loyal Amazon customer. 6/10/21 Update: Alexa Sucks!: Frequently doesn't play what you ask for, or, when it does, stops playing, mid-song, when it wants, then freezes so you can't play any music until ""SHE"" feels like it (even doing a 'unplug' restart doesn't help). These speakers are marketed for Alexa and Amazon Music users and the experience (six months worth) is frustrating, maddening, and just plain bad.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

I had high hopes and was excited for this one with the hub in it. I read all the reviews online and even watched people play it and compare speakers.I don't know if i got a ""lemon"" in the batches but mine has been malfunctioning repeatedly and sadly I think I have to return it :-( I'm really disappointed b/c I want an alexa device with an integrated hub and I got it at good value on a promotion.  I don't want to return it but I need it to work and now she is not responding, and when she does respond there is terrible feedback noise.Pluses:+ acts as hub+ color good+ design goodCons:- it often doesn't understand my voice from nearby and I have to ""shout"" or ""sternly"" give commands- the volume up or down doesn't always take affect and you have to repeat the command- the sound now started to get crackly and play static feedback with it - has started to ""ignore me"" and it will ligt up blue, i will say ""play jazz music"" and it doesn't do anything- i have a dot in a room nearby (but not close), and the dot will often pick up my voice in the enxt room, even though i am on the sofa sitting directly next to the hub one and the hub will not respond----update on review:amazon customer service did try to help. they are sending me a replacement one to see if it is a hardware issue on this specific device that i got. crossing fingers the new one is better.i did speak with the rep about the difference in amazon plus. vs. studio vs. 4th geninteresting to me that the echo plus 2 are still more expensive than the new 4th gen even though they are ""older"" technology.i suspect the plus 2 have the kinks worked out, wish the price would drop.and maybe some of these issues with my new 4th gen device are teething issues with it being a ""new and improved"" design and inner-parts.also an odd note on the customer service - the team that followe dup on a 2star review, they rang me and i asked to call back later. he mentioned he would email me - got the email, the instructinos said ""you can reply directly to this email"" so I took the time to reply to the email but then got the automatic response that said ""you are writing to an email that no longer accepts incoming messages"" s - so he won't see my response and the alternate contact path is to log a new ticket, which i've already done so i wont resend.\n",4 people found this helpful,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

It's spherical look matched the look of the spherical lamps in my living room (Ikea Fodo lamps), purchasing with the intent of moving my Echo Plus to a different room in exchange for this new model being the living room's device.Right away I noticed the sound pickup is weaker than my Echo Plus. Having used the Plus for nearly three years in the same location, I was accustomed to a specific level of voice pickup, especially when first entering my home and prompting Alexa to turn on the lights. This new model needs me to speak much louder to throw my voice enough in order for it to pickup and respond accordingly. That's strike one.Next, while I love the design and the light ring makes sense at the base for this design, I decided very early on that the placement of the light ring at the base is counterintuitive as it's difficult to impossible to see if your prompt was recognized if your vantage point is obstructed; this was not the case with the Echo Plus with it's tall cylindrical design. That's strike two.Finally, the sound quality. Thinking it would sound better than the Echo Plus was logical given the Plus model is several years old and this new model boasts more size to house a decent speaker system. Modern audio devices have really stepped up their game with rich sound and deep bass, so I assumed this would perform exceptionally. Unfortunately, I found the audio quality to fall below that of the Echo Plus. I linked all my echo devices so that music will play across all the devices to fill my home. Walking from my living room (where this new Echo lives) into my art studio (where the Echo Plus was moved to) there is an undeniable difference in sound quality, with the Echo Plus clearly being the superior in sound. This new model suffers by not adopting the 360 sound of the Plus and also sounds to have weaker bass in comparison, even after matching the audio settings to the Plus. That's strike three, which is three strikes too many.My final analysis is that this new Echo isn't much more than a larger Echo Dot with the added benefit of the hub that allows integration with Hue bulbs.I will be placing my Echo Plus back into the living room and redesignating this new model as an Auxiliary device in another part of my home. I may purchase a better quality external sound system for it, but in any case, Amazon needs to revisit the Echo with more focus on sound than the physical design because I feel some sacrifices were made to make a product look pretty.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

Even worse is when Alexa appears to go on strike and just not respond to my requests at all. I dread hearing her frequent plaint, ""I'm sorry. I'm not understanding right now. Try again later."" In addition to these complaints, I have to add that Amazon is still far from the top of its game when it comes to the sound quality of its Echo devices--at least this one. If Amazon is going to tout ""premium sound,"" it should certainly do better. When Alexa speaks, she sounds as if her face is buried in a pillow, and music is by no means crisp, clear, or well balanced. What bass response there is does not make up for imbalances over the rest of the frequency range, which Alexa's equalizer function seems unable to adequately adjust.

I was contacted by customer service and told this issue was being resolved and after a few days it seemed to be,  although i had to recreate my playlists for it to work.  Now, its back to not playing my actual playlist, of music i purchased, but rather plays random music the system deems similar.  I have moved to spotify and will cease buying my music from amazon and will be setting up a system that does not rely on amazon music or the echo devices as it is just too frustrating. Granted amazon already got my money, but they will get no more and i will warn anyone who will listen. It should not be this difficult to play a playlist of music ive prchased. Frankly, i think it's all part of the pressure to force one to subscribe to unlimited, even to access music one has already purchased and it's just wrong. All I wanted was a way to play music.  Alexa has a decent speaket for my purposes and I figure it will work well with my Prime Music.  Ha.  I've never been able to get Alexa (or Echo) to reliably play a playlist without a big hassle.  I took to setting up routines to get the device to play the right playlist.  But now it won't even do that.  Now Alexa will play my playlist - the same one it's played for 3 months - on ""shuffle and similar song"" mode.  I mean, if I wanted random music I'd ask for that and not ask for a playlist.  When I ask to turn off shuffle mode Alexa says it can't.  I checked my prime music and it is NOT on any kind of auto shuffle mode that I can see.  Going with Alexa for music has been a mistake. A device that is supposed to make life easier has been a constant source of frustration and now a complete fail for the purpose I bought it.

The new devices (have 2 now and am kind of regretting it) are a step up with sound quality for sure. But the microphones and voice recognition are really poor. Have to repeat commands (even simple ones like ""end timer"") many times.  Heck, the devices have a hard time picking up ""Alexa"" wake word most of the time. Haven't looked at the internals, but guessing that the physical positioning of microphones in the new ball shaped package was ""good in theory"" but just poor design. Either that or the software upgrades are anything but.And Amazon is not doing anything about the ugly white cords and adapters. Shame. The round package could be cool - if it wasn't for the ugly white only cords and adapters (and performance issues of course). It is fine with the white one we have. It might even work for the blue. But it is gosh-awful with the charcoal unit. If a person wants a dark colored smart device, it is probably in part because the location needs a dark color. Tell me again how white cords/adapters make sense?-------------------------------------------------------------------Overall the device is a step up from 2nd gen device. Sound quality much improved and reasonable for price. Voice recognition not as consistent as with 3rd gen Dots for some reason.Huge esthetics issue: only have white cords and power adapters.

I currently have 2 Echo Shows, 2 4th gen Echos, 2 Echo Dots and an Echo Auto. We've always like the Echo products...until recently. About a month ago, we went to bed and as usual  told Alexa to play our SleepyTime playlist. Sometime in the night, she stopped playing and when we tried to get the playlist going again she said she couldn't reach the internet. When I woke up the next morning, I found our internet was fine so I tried reconnecting the Echo. No matter what I tried, she would not connect. If I asked her a question, she would just reply with ""I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. The internet is not reachable. ""I even did a factory reset - still no good. Thinking it was bad, I went to Best Buy and bought another 4th gen Echo. It too too would not connect. I tried over and over - no good.  So, for kicks, I decided to use my wife's phone and her Amazon account and in the first attempt the device connected. To eliminate my phone as a problem. I opened a brand new Fire Tablet registered to me. I first updated the Alexa app and attempted to connect the 4th gen Echo to my account - no good. We've done coutless resets, but nothing works with my account. Her account, no problem. I have taken the Echo to my work and it does the same thing there as well. The problem with using my wife's account is that all of the other devices, Kasa plugs, Hue lights etc., are attached to my account. I had bought a pack of 4 Kasa plugs and they cannot attach to my account either. I can use them within the Kasa app, but cannot attach them to my Alexa account. Basically, my account is somehow damaged. I called tech support after about 10 days of trying to fix this myself. I was hung-up on twice, but eventually got someone in Echo tech support. After trying many things, even screen sharing from the new Fire tablet, the technician said that this was very unusual and should not be behaving like this. The devices register on my account, but they just won't work. She told me she and her team would need time to  investigate this issue and asked me for a good callback time for the next day. I said 5:30pm would be good. I never got the call and my devices still are not working. Through my efforts, I have eliminated my network, my phone, my tablet, the Alexa app, the Echo devices- everything but my Alexa account. I have no choice at this point but to give them a one star review until this is fixed.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

Not crisp, clean, clear.* BUILT-IN ZIGBEE HUB:  after unplugging the Echo (or after a power outage) Zigbee devices get disconnected and do not automatically reconnect.  It is a huge pain to have to reset and reconnect each device and redo any routines that used those devices.  I also worry about the safety and security of a smart home when devices like heaters, humidifiers, alarms, etc no longer talk to the hub or follow automated commands after after a power outage.  Hopefully this is something that Amazon can fix with a Echo software update.* TEMP SENSOR: I like that there is a temperature sensor, but unlike a standalone Zigbee temperature sensor, the temperature reading from the Echo doesn't show up when I add the Echo to the Favorites section of the Devices page in the Alexa app.  It should.  Seems fixable with an Alexa app update.* FORM FACTOR:  The spherical shape may work for smaller Echo Dots, but in the larger Echo it is not appealing.  In my room it sticks out like a sore thumb.

There however is pitiful mid/treble range on this thing. I'd even go as far as saying my 2nd gen echo dot puts out a fuller sound than this Echo does.Additionally, the voice recognition on this system just isn't as good.

The sound quality was worse and had a hollow tone. You could correct a little with the app but never got to the quality of the original we had.Another big factor for our change was the mic on our 1st gen just wasn\u2019t as responsive after all these years and we found ourselves always yelling at Alexa. However, when we set up this new Gen 4 Echo we found it performed worse than the original. So much so, that the Gen 4 sphere would ignore our commands while the G1 which we moved to a further room away was still picking up our commands.  I\u2019d fault a good bit of this to placement location of the two units, as it\u2019s a little close to a tv but I\u2019m doing an apples to apples comparison of the two different units in the same spot under the same lifestyle home conditions.  We gave it about 14 days of testing before we gave up and decided to return.Also, I\u2019m not sure the spherical design is really any better stylistically or practically. It seems to take up more space and having the light ring on the bottom means you can\u2019t really tell when Alexa is actually hearing your commands.  We ended up repeating ourselves quite often because she just wasn\u2019t acknowledging we were speaking to her. Plus from a volume control standpoint the ring can no longer provide a visual queue as you can\u2019t see all the way around the sphere. Obviously you can ask Alexa what her setting is volume wise, but sometimes you just want to see.Lastly, we bought a blue one. It\u2019s neat that it\u2019s not black like all of our other echoes and dots. But, the exact shade of blue actually wasn\u2019t that appealing once we had it in our house.  It\u2019s almost like they couldn\u2019t decide which shade of blue to use so they just went with blah in the end.Biggest Pro:  I like the idea of the new colors.Biggest Cons: sound quality and mic sensitivityExtra note - we did link it with the multi room sound playback and that feature was easy enough to set up and integrated our G1 Echo with this G4 Echo seamlessly.  It also pointed out more sound flaws though as the G1 outperformed in the end with providing a more dynamic and balanced room filling sound.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

The sensor being ""in"" the Echo enclosure is heavily influenced by the enclosure temp itself(and everything inside). A big/rapid change in temp? the enclosure keeps the Echo from implementing in real time. Have a heater connected? Think this is great to turn on/off by temp? Very slow to respond to either a temp drop in the room(then it turns on the heater in a created routine) and then responds very slowly to turn the heater off when ""off"" routine temp is reached. Seems to me this is a case of an external temp sensor, not in the Echo enclosure would work much better.

I know this both by the feel of the room temperature and because I placed a digital thermometer six inches from the device.  Because of this inconsistency, I couldn't even just manually include an offset for my purposes (a window AC unit plugged into an IoT plug with automations to turn it on/off based on the temperature reading off the sensor).Thinking the first one was just a defective unit, I was sent a replacement... which has the exact same issue.  Clearly the sensor in this generation is just flawed and therefore should not be purchased if you plan to use the temperature readings for anything other than a very rough estimate.Everything else about the device works as-expected and it is a very cool looking unit.If I hadn't bought this specifically for the temperature sensor, I'd probably have given it four stars.

I bought the device to replace my 2nd generation Alexa device that we use in the kitchen/breakfast area.The device does have better sound playback overall. We use it primary for music.  But the device has several issues that make it worse than our ""old"" Alexa: (1) there seems to be a problem with the microphone. It does not capture the voice commands as good as the old device.  Sometimes we have to raise our voice so loud that the ""old"" alexa responds (and she is at the loft at the second floor!).  Most of the times, the commands do not come as intended.  I can hear from the playback of the commands in the history page that they are not as crisp as the ones recorded in the old device. (2) the smarthome integration embedded in the new alexa fights with our current smarthings hub all the time.  When scanning the sensors we see duplicates for most of them: one from the smarthing hub and another one from the alexa device.  Deleting the ones from alexa builtin smarthome hub fixes the issue.  The new alexa does have a better sound, but we resorted on swaping it for our ""old"" alexa instead and move the new alexa to the second floor, where it is rarely used.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Last year, we finally decided it had gotten old enough and traded it in for a new one. That was a mistake.The new Echo's want to be so helpful. Want some music? They'll gladly tell you all about Amazon's Music Unlimited subscription service, that just so happens is NOT included with Prime. Want to listen to the news? It'll turn on TuneIn, which'll make you listen to up to 10 minutes of commercials before actually playing the news. Want to track your Amazon purchases? It'll happily give you notifications, sometimes even without you asking or wanting them, about where your packages are.When the Echo starts blinking yellow, you're supposed to ask it what the notification is. Most of the time, it'll tell you about a Subscribe & Save item that's being delayed, or a package got delivered, etc. But sometimes, it'll recommend a book that you have absolutely no interest in.The book recommendations were my last straw. A little backstory first. As far as I can tell, out of roughly 1500 purchases I've made on Amazon in the last decade, perhaps 5 of them have been books, and none of them for me. They've all been cookbooks, or kids books, as gifts for others. So why, in the name of all that's holy, does the Echo insist on giving me notifications for random books that will be coming out? I don't want them. I don't care what they are. I have never, in the 8 years of owning an Echo, purchased a book through it. I've never asked it to read a book to me. I've never used it to play an audiobook. There is no overlap between what I've told it to do or what I've used it for, and upcoming book releases. That venn diagram is 2 circles with a mile between them. Yet, you CAN NOT disable these notifications. No amount of settings changes, or account updates, or even calling Amazon Tech Support, will remove them.I do not want book notifications. For that reason, I just bought a Homepod Mini, and I'll be returning my Echo. Maybe if Amazon updates their pushy marketing tactics, I'll get another one, but it's not likely.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

Went to investigate the noise. Again the loud crackle and then the music returned. Waited a bit and again. It was happening regularly , about 3 to 4 times a minute.  Unplugged and replugged to see if a reboot would help.  Sitting idle nothing. Asked Alexa to play music and it began playing - and again every 15-20 seconds the loud crackle if 1-2 second length.  Definite hardware failure.By the nature of it I suspect the circuits that feed the digital audio from that source in the cpu over to the digital to analog converter before it goes to the amp , is getting  the data corrupted and so what gets decode isn\u2019t the music signal not now a random jumble of loud digital noise. Packet corruption if you will.So fails on less than a week - a computer or build flaw. Back it goes.

If your voice does not sound very close to how you said her name when you trained her to hear you she does not respond. Re training your voice may help just keep in mind that when you do the training try to pronounce her name at different pitches and volumes so she recognizes you more. It helped me out some but not perfectly.  I think the microphones are under her felt covering making it a little harder for her to hear the correct pronunciation of her own name. That's my best guess.Ok I love Alexa devices. I have 6 various devices in my home.  But this newer echo does not impress me. First of all the voice recognition for me is terrible.

Martin,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on August 16, 2021",The Verdict Is Out,"\nI upgraded to Amazon Music Unlimited and received HD music also. The old dots where working find but wanted to create a stereo pair with better sounding speakers. So I purchased the Echo thinking I would have a sonic experience. What has been the result is as follows. The sound is great until the stream stops. This has been a recurring problem since upgrading and purchasing the speakers. I will tell Alexa to play either my playlist or an artist and it starts out fine. Then partway into the first song it will drop out but then starts again. It will play again with no problem for a few songs and then repeat. Not the sonic experience I was looking for. I have tried on at least 3 occasions contacting Amazon and finding a fix. They have been polite but have offered no solution besides restart everything, start from scratch and disconnect the the devices and the internet and reconnect in reverse order. Nothing has worked. I have a robust connection and stream 4K regularly. I am going to reach out to Amazon one more time and if that does not provide relief I will just drop the unlimited music and give Apple a test run.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

The biggest smart-home items I have that I wanted to connect are my robot vacuum and robot mopper, from Neato and iRobot respectively.The Alexa app has robot vacuums as a main device category, but connecting them is really difficult. For the Neato vacuum, you have to connect your Neato account to Amazon. Fair enough, except that it only works if you used the same email address for both accounts! You will have to change your Neato email address to whatever you use with Amazon. Sorry if you wanted privacy.Connecting the iRobot mopper just didn't work. You have to install the iRobot skill, then add the bot as a device, but it won't connect to my Braava Jet robot at all. There is really no way to get help with it either. Amazon can't offer support for the dozens of 3rd party devices they claim to support, and iRobot doesn't know how to get it to work either. That is a hint of a failing ecosystem.I don't have any smart lights or anything like that yet, so what's left in terms of functionality is low-level features like the flash briefing. But even this seems like it's been neglected by Amazon. Many of the news sources on offer have stopped updating, so you can add them but Alexa just says they are unavailable every time. It's really difficult to customize also. I noticed if you ask Alexa how to edit your flash briefing she gives you inaccurate directions that don't reflect the current version of the Alexa app. If you manage to figure it out, you realize you can't really add useful things to your flash briefing like air quality for your city. It seems the boundaries of the experience are quite narrow, and they are becoming more narrow as the ecosystem shrinks. This is supposed to be a flagship device for Amazon and a key part of their strategy, but the experience has atrophied badly.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

And then they send your Charcoal or Twilight Blue device with a white power cord. Pretty unbelievable that they did not color match the cord, especially since it needs to remain plugged in 100% of the time. Really disappointed. Returning three of these tomorrow. Google Home, here I come.FOLLOW UP - So I got a quick call and email from Amazon. But their response was even more disappointing. Here's the email:Hello, My name is Christian and I\u2019m from Amazon\u2019s Technical Support team. I'm sorry to hear about the issue/s experienced with your 4th Gen Echo, which prompted you to leave a critical review on Amazon.com. I tried to reach you over the phone, but unfortunately we didn't connect.  I understand you're rather concerned about the aesthetics of the white power cord. This was an intentional decision that we made so that the power cord could more easily blend in with white background (think drywall, etc.). Since we'd still like to offer you some options, you're free to purchase a replacement power adapter in black at the link below (your model takes 30 watts): https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079S8K1RPWhat a load of crap - This ""think drywall"" rationale makes sense if you have drywall that is painted white, which I can tell you, no one in the northeastern United States has. Amazon made the decision to throw a white cord in every box to save money on the non-white devices and/or get people to shell out another $20 for the color cord that should have been in the box. Really disappointing from Amazon and really shortsighted.2ND UPDATE - So, Amazon dropped the price on these by $30.00. I bought three of them, so I decide to stick with the Alexas despite the cord issue on the black. I call to get a price adjustment. Nope, you have to return all three and buy three new ones. Clearly Amazon is hoping this will be an impediment to customers trying to get the lower price. I say, that makes no sense because Amazon is going to have to eat additional shipping plus reboxing. Sales rep tells me, they have to do it that way because there are only so many at the sales price. Another customer service line of crap. So, in theory, they are going to take my $100 Alexas, put them on the side and sell them only after the sale. Doubtful.Overall, good product for the money.

I was an early adopter and had it when Amazon only sold it through invitation only.  I was fine upgrading it because it definitely was well used during its life.  I've set the new one up and my negative review is based on playing music (regardless on what model you have).  Since I had echoes back in 2015/2016, you could always have the device play your music from you amazon library of music you purchased through amazon.  For instance, I would say ""Play songs by [particular artist]"".  Or ""Shuffle songs by [artist name]"".  That seems to be rather different in the last couple of months as Amazon upgraded their music services.  Now when I ask Alexa to shuffle or play songs from my library by a particular artist, she will no longer do that, but only play songs through Amazon music service where you are forced to listen to similar artists through their own library.  This is very frustrating and a terrible change.  It seems like they're always trying to get you to subscribe to pay for their premium music service.

So I chose to have it connect to my old Creative Bluetooth speaker, which I have been using with Alexa since my old 2nd gen Echo dot from years ago. Sad really.But even with that Bluetooth speaker, the recognition of the wake word is so unstable. Sometimes I'm having a conversation on the phone or have the TV on (quite a bit of yards away at the opposite side of the room actually), it thinks it heard ""Alexa"", when really no one and nothing said it. I have no idea.Meanwhile, when I actually want to trigger it and I'm actually saying ""Alexa"", it's a hit or miss; either it won't react and I'll have to say it two or three more times, or it will actually work. It works about half the time. When it doesn't work, sometimes I have to scream ""Alexa"" louder and louder just to trigger the wake word. Sometimes it has to be so loud that my throat gets sore just from screaming the wake word.And in my experience, these frustrations I'm having are unique to this Echo 4th generation. I've also owned and used the Echo Dot 2nd Generation (which sounds awful on its own but see my comment about Bluetooth speaker above), and the Echo Dot 3rd Generation. Personally, I wish I just stuck with the Echo Dot 3rd Generation. At least that one only got mistriggered (is that a word? Lol) whenever there was an Alexa ad on the TV.Overall, if you already own an Alexa device, I highly recommend you stay away from this because it'll feel like a downgrade.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

The sound quality is a remarkable improvement over the third generation ""dots."" However, after the first week of continuous use (I keep Alexa busy!), here are some things I noticed, all of which don't spoil my experience with this device.--The microphone to alert Alexa is near the base. So trying to make a request from above the device will not get a reply. This dot is placed by my bedside, but I've elevated it on two books, to make the microphone easily usable.--For those of us who are unable to use a hand-held device, we can't change the settings with any available app for computers--there apparently aren''t any--so we'll use this dot in ""default"" settings. So when I try to bring some music to a dot in one room (I have three third-generation dots besides this ""advanced"" dot), I get an offer by Alexa to switch the music from one device in another room, to the device I'm making the request from, but it never works--either Alexa turns the music off in the other room, or she's unable to turn it off, but nonetheless, I get no music from the dot I'm closest to! So I'm downgrading this to three dots--If the engineers can make an app for computers, I'll raise the rating accordingly.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

My 3rd Gen dots are fantastic, and they're plugged into Edifier speakers, so there's literally nothing new or better for me in the 4th Gen. (Except red spheres are mod and cool.)Plus the new ones, especially the dot, are hard of hearing. And the dot is twice as large (vertically) as it was before, so I'll keep the 3rd Gen one I keep in my suitcase for dog sitting stayovers too. And the 4th Gen don't seem to have good audio jacks, because my Edifiers only play out one speaker, but work fine with the same cable on my 3rd Gen Dot.I did however upgrade my mood lights in my room with RGB smart bulbs, so now I can go purple or whatever color I want. In theory, I could program them to change hue according to the temperature outside, or the price of corn.I also saw that there's a battery base for the 3rd Gen dot, so I'll try that out.

Compared to the prior generation, it doesn't register my voice commands nearly as much and, when it does, it seems to have a higher error rate. I've tried to compensate by moving the device around or just rotating it at different angles, and the problems still exist. I'm seeing some similar comments in the reviews, so I have to conclude that Amazon just ""dropped the ball"" on this one (hilarious, I know.).Would not recommend. Instead spring for an Echo Studio (if you have the spot for a larger speaker) or an Echo Show 8 (if you don't mind the screen), as that model also has really nice sound but does not have the same microphone problems as this model.

I rated two stars because this amounts to false advertising. Otherwise I have been using Echos for years and I am satisfied with most capabilities.I also tried integrating a Hubitat controller with Alexa to send a virtual switch. Unfortunately Alexa routine triggers are limited to schedule and temperature sensor. Alexa will not allow the virtual switch as a trigger.12/20/20 Update:Amazon tech support called me after reading this review. They suggested including all devices in the routine which didn't fix the issue. We also tried deleting and adding back the routine. We tried a schedule trigger instead of a temperature trigger which did work. Basically temperature routines don't work. Today I successfully paired an external zigbee temperature sensor. Temperature based routines still don't work.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

I've had this unit for more than 6 months, but just now getting tired of it's deficiencies and decided to write a review. First off, the smart hub features seem to work fine. My issues are with voice recognition and audio quality. It's pretty crappy.I have a same generation Echo Dot across the room. Often if I'm standing immediately next to this larger Echo hub and say something to it, it doesn't respond, but the one 20 feet away across the room does. Sometimes I can make 2 back-to-back requests, standing next to the unit with my mouth facing it, and with the same voice volume - one of the requests will be answered by it and the other will be answered from the unit 20 feet away.I do not believe it is simply ""confusion"" between the two units.  Before I had the Dot, I would have experienced the hub unit simply not responding to my voice at all.Audio quality is terrible - I have a house full of Echo's including a 1st generation Echo.  It is very muffled, like if you turned up bass to the max, and treble to the min. It's almost as if it simply doesn't produce ANY high frequencies.  My same generation Echo dot, and 1st generation Echo sound FAR better. My Dot w/clock sounds fine.  but this unit, just like the prior edition hub sound like they are under a pillow.  and yes, I have adjusted bass down and treble up...tiny bit of improvement but it still sucks.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

We were impressed with the sound quality of the echo, the depth of sound is pretty good.However!  The quality of the sound is moot when you can\u2019t get the device to actually play music.  This is the most glitchy device I have ever purchased.  We\u2019ve had issues from the beginning.  I would have to reconnect it to the wifi almost daily, sometimes restarting my router just to get the stupid thing to reconnect, even though every other device in the home was connected.Ok, maybe there was something wrong with the signal of our router, so we purchased google routers and placed them all over our house to broadcast the signal better.  I guess that worked because we haven\u2019t had Alexa tell us she\u2019s not connected to the internet anymore.  But NOW she just won\u2019t play music whenever she doesn\u2019t feel like doing it.  In order to get the echo play music nowadays we have to unplug it for a minute and then plug it back in and that will last for a while. If we have music playing in the background for a couple of hours, you can tell when it needs to be unplugged and plugged back in because it will just decide to stop playing music for no reason.Would have returned it right away and given it one star if the sound quality was garbage.

Why should I have to pay $20-30 extra for a color-matched cord? Never has been an issue for past Echo devices, of which I have MANY... 14 I thinkSecond: I've grown fond of the cylinder shape, not a fan of this spherical shape; it might make sense if the sound was not front-firing, but sadly is. I could grow accustomed to that if not for the white cord, which Hubby said he could paint, but why should that even need to be a consideration? Besides, my plan was to add a 2nd one as well and, if they failed, alterations would negate the ability to returnLastly: I have 2 charcoal Gen 3 Echos on that same counter; they have black cords, sound really grea! and look great.

This one sounds ok in a large bedroom, but fails miserably in a smaller bedroom (my craft room). There, it, literally, sounds like what it is...a small basic Bluetooth speaker.  Very treble!  I turned it off an connected my iPad back up to the Bluetooth stereo system instead.  I am going to keep it as it does integrate SiriusXM amongst others, but it will remain in the larger bedroom.  Setup was not terribly fun.  My daughter has a dot (those sound worse than this one) and anytime I told Alexa to do something, it went on HER echo...even though we were on opposite ends of the house.  I think this is made more to be used as a system throughout the house versus a more individual toy. I think I got it sorted out now, but there are still issues. It doesn't always respond and it does go out.  I've read it's a WiFi issue, but nothing else goes out when the echo goes out.

I don't know what it is about the new design, but now it seems to never hear me say the wake up word. I feel like I have to shout Alexa just to get her to light up, so I know she's listening. I'm also super frustrated that podcast can't be fast-forwarded to specific time within the podcast. I use this feature all the time when Alexa plays an audible book, so why can't it be used for podcast as well? I also feel like this most recent iteration of the echo doesn't understand what I'm asking, even though I can  use a similar phrase for my studio Echo and I'll be understood. I tried to buy an adapter to put it on the wall cuz I hate how much space it takes on surfaces, and of course I ended up with a dot wall adapter for the echo instead of this size. I just wish they would call it a different name or a different induration or something to make it identifiable without me having to feel like an expert at the dimensions of each of the objects. I found it really irritating that the cord for the power had been shortened almost a foot, and I couldn't put this new echo in the same location as my old Echo because they switch the power integration port to an AUX port instead of whatever it was before.

Then even with the app set up, most of the skills don't work on the Echo with no explanation given, including flash briefings (I can only get the weather on the Echo, but can get the full list when using the Alexa app).

In two key ways, they have not.1. Mics are less effective.The mics are actually worse at picking up my voice. I find myself repeating the wake word more often, and at a louder volume, just to get the same result. The old cylinder was pretty omni-directional; they new one less so.2. The sound is overly bassy.Yes, you can adjust the bass through the app to tone it down, but you shouldn't have to. I don't have the old and new side by side, so it's hard to judge which sounds better overall, but at least on the default bass setting the new one seems less accurate.What do I like better on the new one? It's shorter, so it doesn't stick out as much on the kitchen island where it lives.

In fact the charge cable it comes with is short, so keep that in mind when thinking about where you wish to place it. I have a first gen alexa and the cable that came with it is longer.A note for Amazon, when this device was first advertised, it showd a globe pattern. When I saw that, I wanted this device.

They have better speakers, and this big one has added a temperature sensor, which is truly a game changer for routines, allowing Alexa to monitor the temperature of a room and adjust accordingly on her own. Howver she NEVER hears me say her name the first time, 80% of the time once she does, she will not hear the command I give her. How is an Echo supposed to work if it cannot understand its user. That is literally the ONLY thing these things need to do--well that and stay connected to the internet. there is a 50/50 shot that when I say her name, she gives me the ""the intertnet isnt accessible"" line.

If you're thinking about it, DON'T DO IT!1) The 4th gen devices don't seem to pick up voice commands as well.  We frequently use the Echo in our family room on the 1st floor.  Even though we are 5 feet away and within line of sight of the Echo, our Echo show upstairs in a room with a *closed* door hears the command instead and prevents the family room Echo from responding.  The activity logs indicate the Echo Show wasn't the intended device, but ultimately none of them respond so we have to repeat the command.2) The sound is awful.  The previous Echo's had a nice range and good base.  The 4th gen echo sounds very hollow and tinny.  If you like to listen to music through your Echo, avoid the 4th gen devices!!3) The light ring is now on the bottom of the Echo, so unless the device is placed at a position lower than you, you probably won't be able to see it.  Considering the mic can't pick up your commands well, you'll often wonder if it's doing anything at all since you get no indications.While not a 4th gen specific issue, the Echo is going to constantly be trying to upsell you on Amazon services.  If you request a song that isn't on Prime, it's going to try and upsell you their Ultimate Music service, then it's going to start playing some ""station"" that is not the song you request.  100% of the time I have to further request that it stop playing the station, which it can't hear me well so I end up yelling for it to stop 4 or 5 times.  Overall, the Echo has gone from a fun device that was worth the potential privacy concerns to an annoying banner ad that you can't click to close.  The current user experience makes me just want to throw these things in the trash and I own 4 of them.\n",3 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Amazon has this on sale, so why not give it a try? 20 minutes--that's about all I can get from the echo before it decides to stop playing and I have to reboot the echo by unplugging and re-plugging the power cable.--I can't even get Alexa to reboot herself.  I bought a sound bar with HDMI passthrough and went back to Apple TV.  I guess if you want to have a conversation with Alexa, maybe this is the device for you.

I still have and use my Gen 1 every day. I currently have 9 of them including Echo Autos, 4 dots, and an Echo Flex. I purchased this 4th gen to replace the 1st gen that I use as the main Echo in my living room. The 1st gen is still working great, but it's not compatible with some of the new Alexa features.We got it last year on black Friday. It would respond to commands OK for a few hours. After that, it would stop responding entirely. You could manually wake it with the button, but it would not hear you at all. A power reset would fix it, for a few hours or a day and then it would happen all over again. After dealing with Amazon, they sent a replacement. The replacement had the same issue. Even when it did work, you had to speak very loud and close. The Echo dots on the other side of the house would respond instead of this one 3 feet away.The Echo was placed in the same location as the one it replaced, on the same network.After going through 2 units, we figured there was some sort of known issue. We returned the second unit and went back to our 1st gen. A year later (hoping that the issues have been worked out), we purchased another unit. Guess what? New unit has the same exact issue.Search Google for Echo 4th gen microphone issues and you will see this happens to a lot of people. Even when they do worth, they don't work nearly as good as previous generations. Which is a shame.For now, this one is going back again and we will continue to use our 1st gen until Amazon can get it together.\n",2 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Other times, I ask the Echo to do something basic like telling me the time, the blue light comes on for a second, but Alexa never says or does anything, not even ""Sorry, I didn't understand you."" The old Echos never did that.The real kicker, though, is the execrable ""by the way"" feature, which constantly asks me if I want to use some ability that I'm not interested in. I find myself actually getting mad and swearing at Alexa when she asks me if I want to try some inane, useless skill.

I sure hope the fifth generation will go back to the sound quality of previous generations.I have had many speakers from every generation going back to the first generation (which ironically, was one of the best sounding speakers they made).Also, when you pair these fourth generation Echo speakers with a Fire TV or Fire TV stick, they are somewhat acceptable on the trailers and previews, since the volume of those, same with commercials, is so artificially boosted, (though the speakers are still disappointingly soft and poor quality), but the minute you start the actual show or movie, the sound instantly becomes so quiet that I would equate it to about a volume level 4 on previous generations.I think these were rushed to market because the engineers thought the new round shape was so cool.

I was fortunate enough to be one of the early owners. It\u2019s been pretty good. I mean\u2026she gets a little mixed up sometimes. Our whole home is integrated with Alexa. Lights, thermostats, plugs, garage door, door locks\u2026you name it. Mostly, we really like it. We use it every day. I love the shopping list most of all but I also like walking into a room and turning on lights or the tv with my voice. I really enjoy changing the temperature without picking up my phone. Love it. I hear Amazon is losing a ton of money on these things so I guess I can see why the quality is going down.We finally upgraded to this new orb because our really old tube style Alexa was getting very hard of hearing. I hate this new one. It\u2019s garbage. I\u2019ll ask a question and she loudly yells at me. The volume is currently set to 3. I\u2019ll ask her the temperature moments later and I can\u2019t hear her but barely. I cannot find a fix for this. I\u2019m just over it.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Don\u2019t waste your money,\nI love Alexa and own multiple Good evening.  ration of them starting from beta version. I highly recommend Alexa to everyone. However I am giving this 4the generation unit 3 stars as there is no significant difference between this and older version.  This newer unit works fine. I bought this newer 4th generation version thinking it must be better than the older version. I was disappointed as I don\u2019t see a much of a difference at all. Sound quality is pretty much same as previous version.  Buttons and volume control ring is better in previous version. The older unit\u2019s volume ring allows you to lower volume quickly with one smooth motion. In newer units you need to press small volume button multiple times to lower volume. This isn\u2019t a show stopper as you can just voice control Alexa to lower volume. All this highlights is that controls were better thought thru in older unit.Bottom line I highly recommend Alexa to any 1st time user.

For whatever reason, the microphone really struggled with me. Commands like ""Alexa, lights at 20% brightness"" or even ""Alexa, lights on"" often failed to register. And when they did, there were often multi second delays. I recently switched to the echo studio for the sound quality, and was surprised with its responsiveness in contrast to the gen 4. It barely drops commands and processes stuff swiftly, despite lacking the newer processor and other tech in the gen 4.As for the sound, well that part's subjective. I wasn't very into how bassy the tuning was, and how much audio processing there seemed to be. YMMV.I'm glad I didn't give up with the echo after my bad experience with the gen 4. Even my brief experience with the echo studio has painted clearly that Alexa is a capable and fast assistant-gen 4 just seems to be a poor hardware to support it.

First and foremost, I love my multiple Echo and Echo dot units (I have six in total); one red and white with the others all being charcoal (black). All are 3rd Gen. the red and white one came with a white cord/adapter to match. ALL of the others in charcoal came with black cord/adapter. I went ahead and ordered the 4th Gen echo sphere in charcoal, and was irritated to see that they had put a white cord/adapter in the box. I contacted Amazon, and they told me the charcoal units should ship with black cord/adapter, not white, which doesn't match at all, and stands out as looking ""mismatched"" with the unit. Amazon sent me another unit which arrived yesterday a charcoal Echo with a WHITE CORD AND ADAPTER. It simply doesn't look right and I can't ""hide"" it. I took a chance on orderingthe new spherical design, and may end up returning both units and sticking with the 3rd Gen units I have. I don't understand why Amazon wouldn't continue matching the units with a cord color that corresponds with the color of the Echo unit. This is too big and they never should have messed with the vertical design. Hate the directional speakers and the bottom light. I may return all my ""balls"" and find the original designs.

I was disappointed a bit that this 4th gen device was not as good at recognizing its wake word ('Alexa'), as my older echo devices.  With the 4th generation device I have to be very careful to directly face the unit and enunciate when using the wake word.  My older units do not require this.(FWIW - I've altered the positioning of this 4th gen device a few times to ensure it wasn't some sort of audio bouncing that was the issue. The unit performs the same regardless of its location.)Also, unlike my older devices, this 4th generation Echo seems to often just not respond if it cannot answer or properly interpret a voice command/request.  I can see the wake word activates the unit but then it does not respond to commands it has trouble with. I have mixed feelings about this.  I don't miss the occasional 'I did not understand that request' (paraphrasing the response older Echo devices used.) but at the same time really dislike the device just going silent as though nothing had been said - and forcing me to wake it again.To be clear - the issues with this 4th generation device are truly minor.I remain a big fan of echo devices and Alexa in general.Solid build quality, excellent speech interpretation, amazing performance overall.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I have to speak so loud (even when no other sounds in the room), I can be heard two rooms away.When Alexa does respond, there's a serious lag and the volume temporarily decreases (long enough that I thought I'd accidentally asked Alexa to lower the volume) only to realize this happens every time I ask Alexa anything.The Echo sound is relatively full.

I never had a problem with Alexa and Alexa devices\u2014until I upgraded to this gen. If you\u2019re considering it, stop. Don\u2019t do it. I have had nothing but trouble. And I\u2019m not alone. Google it. The problem is pervasive and persistent.I plugged it in initially around Dec 1 and have regretted it since. My device randomly plays audacy at an absurd volume and won\u2019t always shut off\u2014sometimes I have to unplug it to get it to stop. I have tried resetting it, reinstalling the app, factory restores, removing all devices from my account, removing all skills/apps from the device, etc. I\u2019ve watched videos, read help pages, and asked friends in IT to help. Nothing\u2014NOTHING\u2014resolves the issue. I have taken my Alexa down to no skills or apps. Basically it\u2019s now an automated list maker and it STILL randomly plays Audacy (and by \u201cplays\u201d I mean \u201cscreams\u201d). It only plays Audacy; nothing else\u2026although it recently started to randomly beep at me. My privacy settings are as locked down as they can be and still\u2014still\u2014the problem remains.Don\u2019t. Do. It. Go to a different system and let Amazon work through its issues in someone else\u2019s home. I\u2019ve had this gen for about 3 months and it\u2019s spent about 1/3 of that time unplugged because the anxiety these random musical attacks trigger makes the whole system not worth it.I miss my Alexa.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

It only plays out of one side - revolutionary! Just pick it up whenever you move and turn the speaker in your direction!Seriously a terrible product, but when compared to Apple home pod.....it's still awful just not as awful as Apple home pod. Setting the bar high is not part of the strategy.  Which brings me to this:  if you want to play anything other than Amazon branded content - you will have to be prepared to battle the device constantly as it refuses to acknowledge that you have the default set to competitor subscriptions. Apple Music is Alexa's arch rival! She will do anything to keep you away from your music. She will try to shove Amazon music subscriptions down your throat even though you have Prime! (Hmmm- need to get rid of that then...).  I can deal with the poor sound quality but not frequent devious detours back to Amazon music as the default and having to reconnect my Apple account.

It reminds me of back when streaming was locked up by only a few companies and the interfaces really sucked.  At least that got a little better over the years, like skip options, etc. Alexa in it's current state feels crippled, crippled because Amazon can, not because it has to.As a device it's a single speaker so limited in it's application and basically a really expensive paper weight when the internet goes down or the amazon servers go down.\n",2 people found this helpful,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

I was shocked but it was customer service to address my concerns. That level of Customer Care is unheard of and for that reason alone I would recommend using the Alexa devices. As for their tips; they showed me my area of lack of knowledge and how to correct it. In the app you can adjust the Bass, Mid, and Treble I didn't know that. Having made this changes the sound is far better. For the mic they had me remove and resync the devices. This shad had a somewhat positive result but it is still to early to be 100% sure. I would say accuracy has gone up 50% but still not fully there. I hope this can be figured out further with software updates. I will update this again in a few months to see if it has changed.

They are also definitely slower than the google home units. This appears to have been a big step backwards in regards to speed.

I purchased 2 of the echo 4th gen speakers and in 2 different homes(on 2 different internet/wifi systems) they would regularly cut out at least every other song.  As such I bought 2 of the new echo dots, and have them bluetoothed to much better speakers and have save >$100.  Sadly, with the 2 brand new echo dots, I am still getting the cut out and at times static but only when I am playing the music over multiple dots.  The echo 4th gen speakers are being returned as the cost does not justify the music regularly cutting out.  I'm sure that at some point they will figure out how to run multiple echo speakers/dots without the music cutting out or high levels of static, but until then I am going to cut my losses.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Unfortunately, every time the Echo connects to BT it announces very loudly ""Connected to iPhone!"" which startles me. I've done research and there have been complaints since 2016 of this but Amazon is not listening to their customers. There is no way to change it. Even if announcements are set to off and brief mode is on.Unfortunately, that meant I have to return and get a Google Nest Audio, which meant if I really want to use the Muse headband I have to switch my smart home to Google.

This thing is a pain in the butt. I bought this to replace my 3rd gen echo. First thing I noticed is the mic barely hears me. My 3rd gen echo hears me loud and clear even when music is blasting I've whispered to it to test it and it heard me fine, but this 4th gen needs to be yelled at 98% of the time I'm less than a foot away from it. Second, I noticed when I played my playlist it had songs missing, so it tells me if I want the missing songs back I have to upgrade to amazon music unlimited for $7.99 a month which makes no sense cause I'm doing amazon music unlimited for  $2.99 a month already. I plugged my 3rd gen back in and the songs on my playlist all came back free of charge and were all there. So I plug my 4th gen back in hoping somehow the issue fixed itself and it's back to telling me I need to pay $7.99 a month again. Seriously? What's wrong with this dysfunctional product? I might return it if it's gonna keep acting like a cheap pile of garbage like this.

So far, the answer is 'no'.  I started simple, testing with a couple of Zigbee lightbulbs I already had. The web page for the Gen4 echo says it supports both of the two bulbs I had (from different mfgs).  It will not discover either of them in a lamp only about 8' away from the Echo.

If I pick a playlist to wake me up, it ALWAYS starts with the first song on the playlist, and it ALWAYS starts with shuffle mode turned off. I've tried asking it to shuffle my playlist when setting my alarm, leaving Spotify on shuffle the night before, and asking Alexa to turn shuffle mode on the night before, but none of them work--it wakes me up with shuffle off. Why is this simple wish so difficult to fulfill? I couldn't find an iPhone app that does this, which is why I bought an Echo.

The rest of the top is just plastic, not speaker.  I didn't think about it at the time but it's a stupid design.  Sound is being pushed out and down.

Other dislikes: I ordered a black Echo but it came with a white cable. It's a minor point but I think a black cable would be more appropriate. Worse however was that the cable is ridiculously short (compared to all my Gen 1 devices) which limits placement without the need for an extension cord. Overall, fairly disappointed and returned. HOWEVER, aside from the cord color and length which would have still resulted in my returning the device, I'm hoping that my ""operationally defective device"" was an anomaly and I just got a bad one.

The alexa app, while better than the google equivalent, still leaves a lot to be desired in terms of finding features.The one feature however that makes me regret my purchase more than anything else though is that you effectively cannot share the device with other household members if you have any intention of using smart home features.Any other users of the echo devices must have full access to your amazon account and be logged in as you. You can set up a household and link ONE more adult's amazon account, but then they have no access to any smart home routines or devices, rendering the whole exercise pointless.I did not see any of these limitations before buying several echos to replace my google devices, however now that I'm aware of it I was able to find complaints about this very thing going back several years.

The table is a quality piece manufactured by Hickory Chair Furniture company.  The Echo\u2019s design is faulty and may damage your furniture.

The gen 4 echo and dot seem to be slower to process commands as well. My gen 1 echo and gen 3 puck perform much better than the gen 4 devices. My gen 4 dot has an issue playing the ambient sound app. I tell it to loop or set a sleep timer to keep playing all night and it shuts off in a matter of minutes. If my gen 1 echo just had a zigbee hub in it I'd be a happy camper.

We put it in the same spot our old gen 3 echo occupied and moved the gen 3 echo to another room. From the start, the gen 4 echo microphone picking up commands whereas our gen 3 echo never had any such problems. It particularly has trouble when it is playing music and you try to give it a command - sometimes it will hear the wake word, but then not understand the command that comes after, sometimes it won't hear the wake word at all. This happens to the point where we are screaming at it to turn off the music and it just keeps playing and playing and our echos in other rooms pick up our commands instead. I reached out to customer service to see if I could get an exchange for another unit as it seemed this one may be defective. Unfortunately, they were only able to offer a return, so back it goes.

It almost constantly just cuts out and stops playing music, iHeartradio, other apps, etc. It very frequently does not ""hear"" us when we say Alexa, gets things wrong, etc. Overall, it's just much, much worse than the first generation that we had. We also have gone through several Echo Dots that are all great, no problems there. This stands out as a really bad device.Amazon's ""customer service"" is also terrible. The only option we've found is a worthless bot that asks a series of questions that inevitably lead to saying to restart the device then to do a factory reset. We've done both multiple times, it doesn't help.I don't know if we'll stick with Echos we may just switch over to Google. Too bad, we were happy with the Echos until this purchase.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Being able to interact with them via voice is a critical capability (it's the whole point of these units), and the voice recognition on these units compared to the dots I have and my phone is vastly inferior, especially if any music is playing. I do appreciate the fact that they have a zigbee hub integrated and I have taken advantage of this, but the poor quality of the microphone is extremely frustrating.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

However, it's in my Office group and before I purchased this I would walk into my office and say Alexa turn on the office, and the lights would come on.  Now, I do the same command and receive Alexa doesn't support that and it turns off.  I have to say, ""Alexa, turn on the lights"" and the office lights come on and random other lights come on too, not in the group at all. Lights on the other side of the house come on or turn off... my wife hates that!What is the fix? Or do I play baseball with it?  This thing is driving me crazy.

The echo itself changed volume of every different tv station , some real high, some real low. And get this, to change the volume up or down ,you have to do it on your phone app. So that means leaving your phone on ALL the time. I tried at least an hour for over a week now to get these things paired together and workable. Until this morning when i gave up and unplugged them so I could use my tv speakers again. Maybe I can get something for them on Ebay. My worst amazon buy yet.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Amazon, why did you put a white cord with a black device? Looks stupid. Also, this round Echo takes up way more than my older Echo. I purchased this Echo 4th generation to replace an older Echo 2nd generation I had purchased in October of 2019, because it was cutting out on me. While playing a radio station, or playing Amazon music unlimited, it kept just randomly turning off. Even after calling customer service, and wasting hours of my time trying to fix it, unplugging it,  resetting  it, etc., it still did not fix the problem. I was only willing to purchase this new one because it was on an early Black Friday deal, and I had some points. I hope I don\u2019t have problems with this one.

It would stay stuck on the other profile even after 3 factory resets while communicating with support for almost 2.5 hours. The only resolution was to remove the other account from the household thus losing the benefits of that service. Support said a ticket was put in however, I've yet to receive any communication indicating that is the case. I firmly believe it isn't an issue with the device itself rather, the servers/services running behind the scenes because it appears to try to default to the other account as soon as it is added back.

The original started glitching quite frequently and voice recognition was deteriorating.  We decided to stick with echo since we had enjoyed the original for so long.  However upon receipt of the new echo, despite better sound quality, we immediately found voice recognition was even worse.  Not to mention having to make the same request 4 to 5 times before the new echo responded.  Additionally it frequently cuts out when playing music then begins playing again minutes later.  Had we not wiped and recycled the original echo, I would have it plugged back in and this one sent back.  Highly regret purchasing this echo.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

My Amazon Tap sounds far better than this.2) Power Cord - I bought a black Echo.  It comes with a ""glacier white"" power cord.  How many electronics come with a white power cord?  Nearly none.  Weird.  Plus, the actual plug is HUGE!!!  Plan on it blocking plenty of stuff on your power strip.  (Note: picture attached is about the only clue that you get a white cord, and the size of the plug shown is NOT to scale!)3) Portability - for something this big, adding a battery inside the ball and a small charging base into which the cord would plug could have been easy.  Instead, they chose to add a clunky battery base for way too much cost.  Which won't be bought by many (if any).  Again, win - Amazon Tap.From a customer experience perspective, the design is a fail.But I'll have voice control for my roller shades, so there's that.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I thought the Echo (smart speaker) was one of the best and most innovative items I have come across in years.  However, they have continued to change functionality and seem determined to push more advertisements and assertive questions from Alexa.  The change in November 2022 to ""upgrade"" Prime users is just lousy.  No longer being able to have Alexa play a specific song, album, artist, or playlist and instead being at the whim of Amazon's algorithms to play whatever semi-related songs completely changes the functionality and value.  This has to have been done to push more people to pay for Amazon Unlimited, but instead it is pushing us to consider not renewing our Prime membership that we have had for more than 12 years.\n",2 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

It won\u2019t work if you play music for your cat or houseplants. It has a decision making function that turns the music off when it decides you aren\u2019t there. This is programming discrimination from a senior citizen point of few, because we don\u2019t tend to move around in a frenzy of activity. Leaving the room for 5 minutes to use the bath shuts it off. Reading for too long, getting lost in the music, meditating, or reflecting does also. If you are listening to the playlist of an artist on Amazon Music, telling it to turn back on starts the list from the beginning, rather than picking up where it left off. I wish it worked more like the machine it is, and less like the set of programmed assumptions that are inescapably built into the service. It\u2019s simpler than having a CD player and large collection of CDs, but it\u2019s not necessarily better.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

EVER!!!","\nThis is the worst excuse for AI ever.  More like ""L.A.I.E."" , lowest artificial intelligence ever!  It never understands what is asked.  If it does, it gives a long drawn out ridiculous answer or gives random answers that have nothing to do with the question.  Ask it what the ""current temperature is"", it will tell you but then it wants to know if you want tomorrows forecast, or the current humidity, when all you asked it was for the current temp.  Ask it how to spell Moderna, it spells Madonna.  It is VERY irritating to go thru a bunch of garbage every time you want to know something.  These things are stuck a decade behind.  We have 3 (2 of the older tall ones and one  ""dot"" located in different areas of the house).It's a whole lot easier to look things up on Google or Bing than to ask Alexa, and a whole lot less frustrating. The chances of getting a correct answer from Alexa is MAYBE 1 out of 10, if, and that's a BIG IF she understands your question.  We mainly use it to turn our lights on/off because it's convenient for our elderly Mother but that is even very ""if-ie"".  For sure it's  been a big waste of money, time (since it doesn't keep our settings for it) and patience.  For sure NOT WORTH it.

You can control a myriad of devices with it; so many things are ""Alexa integrated.""

You cannot ask it it to do ANYTHING, without it coming back with a ""Did you know you can . . . ""  or ""Would like to learn more about <insert feature here>""  I don't ask it the time, because it wants me know about time in China, or Africa.  I can't add things to the shopping list without it advertising Whole Foods.  I can't set a timer, without it telling me all sorts of useless other ways I can also use a timer.

Echo is a lower cost alternative to products like Sonos, Heos. Blue Sound and alike.  Functionality is limited and the sound quality is subpar by comparison, guess you get what you pay for.My biggest frustration with this product is that it does not allow streaming of a local music collection to the multiroom group.  I have spent time collecting my own music over the last few decades and all though I appreciate streaming services like Amazon Music and Pandora sometimes I just want to listen to my own stuff.I have made many attempts at asking for a feature upgrade with Amazon Music but all I have received from them is a canned response thanking me for my interest in product improvement.  At this time, I am going to part ways with Echo and pursue one of the more robust options.  It is a shame however that they don't want to compete on functionality as not everyone is an audiophile and the sound and price point of the Echo family of products is reasonable to most.Hope some of you find this useful.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

According to Forbes, ""the driver for this campaign is an IoT SURVEILLANCE ECOSYSTEM aimed at the domestic market and powered by AI (Artificial intelligence."" ""hello, Dave"" (I suppose that ages me! lol)In Amazon Sidewalk, the benefits go to Amazon and the RISKS go to us, the consumer. Strangers are able to be tracked and have their device (ie key finder/tile fobs, neighbors camera system when it has connectivity problems with their systems) connect to the Internet through MY Amazon and Ring devices. All without their knowledge or mine.If Amazon Sidewalk were solving a problem we actually had, I suspect we would have been given the option to opt in or not because the benefits would have sold themselves and Amazon would have been proud of their ""new features.""Security is promised... (by those profiting form it, not invested in your security) Common sense tells us that not only is that unlikely to be true, but that's also not how things worked out with the plethora of security breaches of past years!It's foolish to assume that if Amazon is willing to unilaterally make the decision to build a network for themselves using my devices today, that this is the last time they'll do anything of that nature.

The ball shape is shorter and generally more appealing than the ""Pringles can"" gen1 model.The bad: The ring of lights is at the base of the ball and it's not possible to see how much is lit when you're adjusting the volume.  It was more intuitive to turn the lid of the gen1 to adjust the volume than it is to repeatedly mash the buttons.  The speaker is centrally located on our kitchen counter and Gen1 worked very well because it was omnidirectional, but the gen4 model is directional so we have to decide how to aim it, neglecting either the living room or the dining room.  Possibly the worst offense is that our voice remote control is not supported in this device!Summary: I prefer the Gen1 Echo Plus to this model.  If it wasn't a gift I would have returned it - there is no big reason to upgrade from the Gen1 model.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

It seems to connect well with the internet and has many admirable traits. However, I bought two of these so that I could pair them in stereo. They pair easily into stereo, but they will not play more than two or three songs without stopping. This makes playing an entire playlist a very unhappy experience. I also cannot give customer service a very good score. After trying several times intermittently over several months to pair and unpair the speakers, and then checking all the settings I could find, I called customer service. The people at customer service were very nice but after telling me to do things I had done several times, they asked me to hold and each time they asked me to hold I was disconnected. I have finally given up using these in stereo and have connected speakers to an older echo which does not produce as good a sound. I may try Google to see if their stereo sets up better. I can recommend these as individual units, but they to not work well as a stereo set.  Two stars as I bought them to pair up.  I have learned to send thing back more quickly with Amazon's excellent returns policy.  One more complaint, since they have decided to add an Alexa calendar to the Alexa app, I have had problems with the calendar working correctly. And, yes I have changed the calendar settings in the app several times.  It seems to just revert to the incorrect setting. One more strike against Echo and Alexa.Addition:After I posted this review, I was contacted by Amazon about the problems with stereo connection, but after several attempts to correct the problem, they seemed to not have any more suggestion, and the matter seems to have been dropped.  Also Echo will no longer add calendar items with out a voice profile.  We have only one calendar that we use as a family, but that doesn't seem to matter.  Echo also adds calendar items to Alexa calendar even though we keep trying to turn it off (it seems to restart itself) and the items never make it to the synced calendar unless we remember to transfer the items from the Alexa calendar.  I am afraid that Echo is becoming less and less useful without becoming more and more intrusive.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

The dot can be pointed in any direction and the sound quality appears to the the same.The biggest negative is that the ball frequently doesn't hear me when I speak to it.

So I just had to get one for my new office. Replaced light switches with smart switches and a couple of smart plugs. This echo was easy to set up. Most difficult was the wi-fi for what ever reason. Has nice sound for music play back. Controls switches and plugs extremely well. But my smart lock to-date hasn't paired. Not a big deal. But having to yell to get lights turned on is annoying.  This round echo seems to be hard of hearing. The taller cylindrical echos,( 2nd&3rd generation), seemed to have a better mic array. The echo ball seems to not hear as well, and find myself yelling or talking loudly to get a response. The white plug and cord is a bit sightly sitting on top of a filing cabinet. So in my opinion this new echo isn't quite up to par with the daily operations as the older 3rd generation echos I own. Maybe since it sits higher it doesn't capture sound as well.

I now wish I'd gone with the Echo Studio instead. I'm not pleased with the sound quality of the Echo 4. The voice clarity is not as good as my original Echo 1, but even worse the music sound quality is not as good as the Echo 1. Partly, I miss the 360 degree sound projection of the Echo 1. The Echo 4 sound quality changes markedly depending on which direction you are from the device. The bass is a bit too heavy, and the treble is very muted. I adjusted the equalizer on the device to reduce the bass and increased the treble to maximum but this barely improved the equalization.Another issue I'm having, which never happened with the Echo 1 is that the Echo 4 will not respond to ""Alexa Stop"" when music is playing. In fact, I can't get the device to stop playing music with any command so I have to unplug it. Very frustrating.The good news is that the Echo 4 controls my Zigbee devices and setup of Zigbee devices was easy.If sound quality is important to you, I would recommend spending more for the Echo Studio and that's what I will do. The Echo 4 was a step down from my Echo 1 in every respect aside from Zigbee.UPDATE: I spoke with Amazon on the telephone (went online, submitted my phone number and they called me right away). Amazon (incredible employee named Gwen) took the time to work with me on methodical solutions to my problems with the Echo 4. She completely stood behind their product and their service. Gwen offered to replace the Echo 4, but since they aren't currently available she instead refunded the amount instantly. I subsequently found a solution to the problem with Alexa not responding to voice commands and it is now working as intended (I deleted the Groups I created for my various Echo devices around the house - this seems to have caused problems with certain devices not responding). I let Gwen know this, but she provided the refund and doesn't require me to return the Echo. I am 100% satisfied with Amazon support and customer service, and this gives me 100% confidence to continue buying their products. Amazon customer service completely exceeded my wildest expectations.

The sound quality isn't as good in my opinion.  It's more directional vs the 360 sound I have know to come and love.  The microphone seems more direction as well.  It seems like it can't hear me at all angles so I find myself repeating often.  The absolute worst part is when added to a mesh of existing dots this Alexa proved to be unintelligent.  Alexa turn on television... my kitchen lights went on.  Alexa turn on cable.....no device found.  Look in the app and it shows ""ke bel.""  Alexa turn on Garage.... the device does not support this.... despite it being a group for the past year and working on all my other devices.  I have nearly every Amazon device.  This one is not worth it.  I miss my gen 1.  I even spent hours in the app re-doing my voice profile and everything including setting preferred speakers.  It just doesn't seem to be as good as the previous versions.  Sometimes I have to yell at it so loud that my other devices upstairs hear me and take over.  Totally bizarre.Update 10/30/2022 - There is a flaw with this new version.  I have ""start of request sound"" enabled on all of my amazon devices.  I can simply say ""Alexa turn on cable"" without any pause between Alexa and the rest of the sentence and she does her thing.  This new version however it is like they didn't shield alexa from it's own sounds or stops recording when it plays the wake sound.  Going in voice activity in the alexa app and re-playing the sounds and looking at what she heard will make this painfully obvious.  ""alexa turn on cable"" shows up as ""alexa turn on ke bel.""  Play back the audio and u will hear ""Alexa turn on ca <wake sound> ble>.""  This is a huge product flaw in my opinion.  To fix it turn off the start of request sound and she operates like normal.  Use the end of request sound only if you speak like me.Update 12/31/2020 - I decided to return the device for several reasons. The microphone as many others have discovered is flawed. It's not sensitive. You have to talk so loud other devices on different floors of your home hear you. No software update can fix bad hardware. Competitor devices have the ability to adjust mic sensitivity which is awesome. How do I know? After amazon started removing my reviews bc they were suspicious with no other explanation I am replacing all my alexa devices with their main competition and man they are better in every way so far. goodbye alexa.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

So I tried this one had it for a week the sound was okay but not to my liking ended up returning it I ended up getting a deal on the second generation echo which is the same as the third generation except for a hub built in at a good deal a third of what they charge for when they were new on woot.com that is owned by Amazon They were used but in great condition I purchased two and paired them as stereo and the sound is great to me. The only thing that beats it would be the echo Studio which I had one but are twice the cost of what I paid for the older echo devices. If you don't have a sound bar and just add a couple of echoes you can add it as a home theater mode but they have to be the same device. I tried it on the echo Studio the problem was it wasn't very easy to disconnect when you wanted to. I have a Vizio elevate Dolby Atmos soundbar that is excellent when I wake up in the morning or when I'm going to sleep I don't want the sound bar on and my TV speakers will play that I want. With pairing echoes in home theater like I said you cannot just turn it off easy and listen to your TV speakers that should be something Amazon should fix. But the sound I got from this echo device kind of seemed hollow to me like they're restricting it with the globe from coming out the sound even though it has two tweeters. Those echo second generations give off a 360\xb0 sound and gave me that close feeling to the echo Studio that I wanted with sound coming from areas you wouldn't think it would come from this unit did not do that.

Sometimes I call it 7-9 times before giving up and asking Google Nest or another Echo device. The ring light on the bottom is a poor design choice as well. There's just nothing new or exciting (besides colour) about Generation 4. Yes she's a bit quicker but sometimes that's a negative because she closes out before you get a chance to say anything/finish your question. Too much hassle to send back but will be last Amazon smart device until they come up with something new/exciting.I can't even find any use or even mention of the zigbee hub. The one thing I love which is probably unimportant to most is the indoor temperature feature. Love knowing the temperature in my room by asking. This is extremely hard of hearing and never wakes up when I ask it to, yet wakes up when its dead quiet. Very strange experience this purchase. Hopefully Amazon can release a fix (OTA) for the hearing issue as its a major issue and walking to control the echo 4 defeats its purpose.Update- no firmware updates have fixed anything yet, I love my echoes but I wish I had of bought another one with a screen as I find those ones 1000 times more useful.
