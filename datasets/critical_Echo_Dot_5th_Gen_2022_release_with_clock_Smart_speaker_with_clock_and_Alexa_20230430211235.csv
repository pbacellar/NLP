Echo_Dot_5th_Gen_2022_release_with_clock_Smart_speaker_with_clock_and_Alexa,39.99,,,Dr. F.Khan,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on March 4, 2023","Very clean design and nice LED and a couple of nice features, but horrible responses.","\nI got this Amazon Alexa Echo with clock after switching from a Google Nest Mini 2.Here are some positives and negatives:Positives:- Almost instant reply and response (Google Nest had a very slow response)- The clock feature- It can tell you your room temperature- You can whisper and it\u2019ll whisper back which is especially useful during the nighttime.- You can change its wake phrase.- It has many different and unique \u201cskills\u201d available.- It has very nice LED lights on the bottom.Negatives:- Although it has almost instant response, it\u2019s responses are not very helpful or accurate when compared to a Google assistant.- Sometimes it just completely ignores what you\u2019re saying even when it activates, and other times when you tell it to turn on the light or turn it off or turn on a switch, it doesn\u2019t work the first time and you have to try a second time.- The Alexa app on your phone is absolutely atrocious! This app is extremely buggy and it\u2019s an absolute mess to find certain settings or features and very cluttered! The google home app on the other hand, had a very clean UI and interface and was easy to use and find settings.The reason I rated this a 3/5, is because although it has a lot of very nice features, if it doesn\u2019t do the most important things properly, it gets very frustrating and makes the other features somewhat overlooked.Overall, I\u2019d still prefer a google nest mini over this, but if the negatives are fixed or improved, then I\u2019d definitely recommend the Alexa.\n",6 people found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only

I was excited to order the 5th generation...but my excitement quickly turned to frustration with the clock display.First, the display is too blocky.  Every number or letter is composed of large dots leading to squared corners. Although it is a bigger display, I think it is harder to read and not very attractive.  The previous version has rounded corners and is much easier to read.The worst issue for me is the brightness of the display.  The Echo Dot does not auto-adjust the brightness like my other two 4th generation Echo Dots.  I could turn on the room light, and the clock would get brighter to make it more visible.  Also, when I turned off the room light, the clock display would dim to a very appropriate level.  The 5th generation Echo Dot does not do this.  I have tried adjusting the brightness level so the Echo Dot can ""learn"" my preference, but the feature is a failure.  I have to manually go into the app to adjust the display at night because it brightens up the room regardless of the light adjusting around it.  I never had to use the app to adjust the display on my other two Dots.I have not tried the other new features with this 5th generation version.  I am sure they are great, but I will be returning this item.  Hopefully, the next Echo Dot release will fix the clock display.\n",5 people found this helpful,Color: Cloud BlueConfiguration: Device only

Trade-in program made that a reasonable option. Coincidentally, the day that I looked on Amazon is the day they released this new generation for pre-order.Form factor is almost identical to the previous. Features are good. Display is now a dot matrix, which is definitely more flexible in terms of what it can display. But two things keep me from recommending this speaker:1) Poor sound quality versus the previous dot (in the same exact location and environment as my old one). Fine for podcasts, but music sounds like the bit rate is heavily compressed. Highs are harsh and uneven, and they don't extend much. Mids are messy. Bass is decent enough for the size of the speaker, comparable to the last one. One of the biggest grievances is the compression (not only of bit rate, but also of tone and volume). Even with the EQ set totally flat and at low/moderate volume, you can hear the speaker constantly adjusting to prevent overdriving the little speaker. I've dialed the bass on mine almost all the way down and it still has a boomy and compressy sound to it. Ultimately, it just sounds like a cheap speaker subject to way too much processing to make it sound almost adequate to most casual listeners. My old one sounded WAY cleaner.. Even enjoyable. I previously never felt compelled to bring another speaker into my bathroom, but now I want to. But....2) They got rid of the 3.5mm output. Now your only option for improving the mediocre sound quality is to pair to a Bluetooth speaker, which, in my experience, is wonky at best. If your device shows up at all (my Klipsch One II from my kitchen does not), you'll likely run into the issue of the speaker automatically shutting down after not receiving a signal for a while.So ultimately, I regret this purchase. Stick with the previous generation. If you can utilize the trade program more than once, I'll likely trade this one for the old one, despite still having a couple 1st and 2nd generation devices.

When linking the doorbell and/or stick up Ring cameras to Alexa the audible Ring notifications go to the Echo Dot and not to your IPhone.  This means that when you are away from home your Echo Dot will be announcing the notifications to an empty room while your IPhone is silent.  There is no provision in the Alexa software to send verbal notifications to both your IPhone and to the Echo Dot.  The only way to work around this is to unclick the notifications to the Echo Dot in the Alexa software. That way you continue to get verbal notifications on your IPhone but not on the Echo Dot.  This seems like a software problem that could be easily solved but it has not.  I contacted Amazon support and they confirmed that there is no fix except to turn off notifications from to the Echo Dot for each camera.  Otherwise the device seems to be working properly.Update:  I tried to continue using the Echo Dot with the Ring alarm system bypassing the cameras.  The Echo Dot makes itself part of the Ring alarm system by listening for loud noises and then sounding a separate alarm on the Echo Dot if it hears something. The Echo Dot is in my bedroom.  My Ring alarm system is in an adjacent guest house.  When I arm the Ring alarm system for ""Away"" the Echo Dot makes itself part of that system and alarms whenever I move around in the main house.  The only way to fix this problem, according to Ring and Alexa, is to disable the Ring alarm in the Echo Dot.

We\u2019ve had a generation 3 for years, and thought it could be useful to buy another for our home. After unwrapping it we tried to set it up. We got through most of the set up steps just fine, but once we got to the step to connect it to Wi-Fi, it just sat and searched for well-over the recommended 5 minutes. After this happened, we tried unplugging it and trying again. We got the same result. I then took it into another room, right next to the Wi-Fi router and tried again. No change in the outcome. On the Amazon app, I started going trough their trouble shooting steps. It walked me through factory resetting the device which still didn\u2019t solve the issue. After trying a little longer (this whole process took about 45 minutes up to this point) I gave up and called their help line. The agent was super kind and proceeded to walk me through the same exact steps that I tried before calling. After 30 minutes on the phone the agent couldn\u2019t help me get any results either. They are sending me a replacement and no additional cost. Hopefully the next one works.Update - I received a new one after the exchange and after working with customer care for two hours trying to troubleshoot the problem they still were unable to help. I am returning this item and getting my money back. I would suggest you keep your money and not waste your time with this item.\n",,Color: Cloud BlueConfiguration: Device only

They look cute and have some great features. When they actually play music and respond to commands, they\u2019re great! But we find ourselves getting frustrated with them more often than not.Here are a couple issues with the Echo Dots, just off the top of my head.1) When I open Amazon Music on my phone and click airplay to play music through the speaker, my Dots don\u2019t show up as a device. Ever. This is the only Bluetooth speaker/app that I have this problem with.2) It constantly disconnects from our WiFi. With verbal commands, I\u2019ll say, \u201cAlexa, play ___.\u201d And she\u2019ll say, \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t connect to ___ right now.\u201d Every other device in our house is still connected to the internet, so it\u2019s not a problem with our internet router. It\u2019s only this speaker.3) There doesn\u2019t seem to be a way for a second household member on a shared Amazon plan to control the speakers and groups in the Alexa app. For example, we use the Dots to turn our living room lights on and off. My husband is the one who purchased them on his Amazon account. But we have a shared Family plan. There is no way for me to dim the lights or turn them on/off in my Alexa app without logging into HIS account. I have to say it out loud, which gets extremely annoying.4) We have 4 of these speakers total between upstairs and downstairs. When I\u2019m in the kitchen and I say something to the speaker downstairs, a lot of times, it\u2019s the one upstairs that hears me and responds, and goes off on a tangent about how she\u2019s not able to connect. The one closest to me often doesn\u2019t respond. It gets old. I guess you can only have 1 or 2 of these in a single house.But here are the pros:-Alexa works great as a timer in the kitchen.-I like the digital clock.-When she\u2019s actually able to connect, the sound quality is great.-We sometimes use them as intercoms to talk to each other within the house, which is fun.-I like the simple design and size of the white dot.Overall, I like the Echo speakers, but they can be incredibly frustrating at times.\n",,Color: Cloud BlueConfiguration: Device only

Of course we (my wife and I) were happy since, from the advertised product description and features, everything seemed a novelty, and very straight forward to set up, given that all our electronics (purchased from Amazon), Smart TVs, AVR, NAS, Shield TV, that is, our whole Home Entertainment Center components, plus some others devices, were advertised to have ""Alexa built in"" (Samsung and LG TVs), or to ""work with Alexa"".However, what was supposed to be an easy setup of each of those devices to work with Alexa and the Echo Dot haven't got us anywhere close to the wonders that we expected. Almost all of the ""Skills"" needed for managing or using our devices thru Alexa weren't even listed on the app, or were to be found amidst, sometimes hundreds, of listed skills for different devices. In other cases (Samsung QLED smart tv 2021 model, LG NanoCell TV 2019 model, Nvidia Shield TV, for example) we even needed to download to our mobile devices the target devices apps . We then started to look into forums, videos and web pages (Alexa's Echo Dot Manual is really useless beyond the plugging it, setting the basics from the app and knowing what button is for what and what each led coloring means).First of all, living in Venezuela, much of the skills weren't available to us, be from the device to link to Alexa, and others simply required to first install their App (i.e.: Smart Things, LG ThinQ, Yamaha MultiCast and Nvidia Shield TV) on our mobile devices (mainly iPads and iPhones) create and/or login in to each of the accounts of those apps to then authorize the linking of the accounts with Alexa (may I say with little or not practical success or results in some of them). And that is just speaking about the linking of devices and apps accounts. When it comes to what you can manage them to play media (music, videos, etc., saved in them) giving Alexa voice commands (caution: I'm not even speaking about smart home and appliances, which I haven't tested or can use with Alexa) or just turning them on and off, we haven't have any success, so the only thing we can listen to with Echo Dot is some unlimited Free Music from Amazon. For other we'll need a subscription (As Alexa's voice advertises it when asked to play some music).What have achieved so far is: Although the Echo Dot connects (pairs) with Shield TV (and it says so with Alexa's voice) we couldn't get any of the promised features on Nvidia Shield TV site regarding Alexa. Another example, in the case of our Synology NAS Audio Station, setup has been impossible since in order for it to work you need a domain name, a DDNS service provider (not all work in sync between my Synology NAS and my Netgear Nighthawk router) plus a trusted authority SSL certificate (at least 2 of the above require to be purchased), since to access them it has to go through the Internet and Amazon (seriously?), no local network streaming without Amazon as Middle-man. Weird? or Social Engineering through invasion of privacy?And so arises the issue for what appeared to be the simplest of the settings: having Alexa Echo Dot to play our collection of music or videos saved on different devices connected thru our home network to constitute our Home Entertainment Center, and most of which were recorded or copied for years from our legally purchased LPs, CDs, DVDs, and BDs it doesn't mater if the music or video is stored in our IOS devices, or our our PC iTunes, our NAS music & video streaming apps. With Echo Dot we could only do that with Music purchased or paid streaming services, either from Amazon, Apple Music, etc., which, by the way, are not sold to residents of Venezuela.In truth, we have been playing or streaming music and videos, at least for the last 4 years,  from my IOS devices, my Synology NAS or just my Windows PC to my TV sets, my Nvidia Shield TV and my home Entertainment Center (AVR + Surround Speakers + Smart TV's + Nvidia Shield TV), all connected through my home wired local Network as well as Wi-Fi, or just Bluetooth, using mostly a single remote control per room (or the iPhone), which also have a microphone feature (Samsung QLED, LG NanoCell, Nvidia Shield, IOS devices, etc.) with voice command capabilities (Bixby, Google Assistant, Siri, and Cortana) and most of those remotes (or apps) are now ""universal"" and very easy to use with multiple interconnected devices using Audio Return Channel (ARC) with HDMI.Don't get me wrong, the features that Alexa and the Echo Dot offer, if you have access to paid services (DDNS, Domain Name, SSL certificate, Amazon, Apple and other media streaming services --as I said, I'm not even looking into the smart home features--and you like the novelty of it all, it seems something nice to have. But, in our case, beyond the novelty of speaking to a device (what I have been doing with Bixby, Google Assistant, Siri and Cortana for a while) to do the same it will be nice (but not really a necessity) Provided that that it really works and integrates seamlessly, which requires Amazon and manufacturers of devices designed to ""work with Alexa"",  or with ""Alexa Built In"" iron out many of the shortcomings described. Guys seamless interoperability between different devices and Operating Systems is really a critical success factor in today's tech world. However, right now, at our home we can do all that is promised by the combo Alexa-Echo Dot, but without any of the described issues, just by pushing a couple of buttons on, or just talking into, a remote control with mic. So it isn't worth to purchase something like Echo Dot to use with Alexa, even at the low prices that they are sold.\n",5 people found this helpful,Color: Cloud BlueConfiguration: Device only
