Echo_Dot_5th_Gen_2022_release_With_bigger_vibrant_sound_helpful_routines_and_Alexa,29.99,,,Dave Bolduc,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on March 14, 2023",Did Alexa get stupider or is it just me?,"\nThe product looks quite sharp. The design look is quite pleasant and the volume and sound quality are remarkably good for a unit the size of a softball. The WiFi range is lacking, severely. My office is the farthest room away from my router but she is the only device with connectivity issues. I have a 2012 laptop that gets 4 bars in the same spot. She gets about 2. The voice recognition software is very impressive. She can distinguish my voice clearly from others with a room full of several chatting people and music/tv going in the backround. I have a very odd accent as I've spent each quarter of my 40 years in a different corner of the United States but she seems to have adapted rather easily and rarely fails to understand a command on the first try. I pulled stars because despite all her new bells and whistles she seems to have lost quite a bit of her playfulness and more basic commands. When she misunderstands a command, she does not even get it close and I get a lot of the defacto ""I'm sorry I can't do that"" responses to simple queries. When I was younger I remember sitting having an hour long smart-alec b.s. trash talking session with my uncle's Alexa. This one is boring and no fun to joke around with. She also cannot retain instructions and preferences by voice. Some can be done via the app. But if I wanted to interact with the app on my phone, I wouldn't have bought the pod. I've told her endless times that Spotify is my preferred music player, but unless I specify Spotify in the command she defers to Amazon music. Overall she's become more Amazon's than my own product. Much less independent. Amazon should be giving these away for free for the amount of permission and intrusions needed just to use her. It claims she can integrate with any Bluetooth audio device. This is a lie. She can scan and find her own products no problem but my expensive non-amazon Bluetooth audio devices are invisible to her. The Alexa accessories like light switches, cameras, speakers, thermostats are fairly cheap and basic and allow little to no user customization or expansion. The level of integration is also very basic. About as complex as simply getting a ""clap-on/clap off"" light switch. Now if there was a smart plug hub where I could plug in all my office devices and instruct her to power on my workstation upon entry to my office(meaning activate my computer, desk light, air conditioning, and interactive display) but leave the rest of my electrical devices plugged in there deactivated unless instructed otherwise, that would be neat. I'm also somehow quite uncomfortable with giving her access to any cameras in her home as we know Alexa has behaved as a spy and unauthorized gatherer of personal information in the past. This model has a ""privacy mode"" based on the honor system and a very reassuring red light to designate this.  Yeah, trust is a hard thing to get back once you've betrayed it. She does not have a battery. This is a major design flaw. My 20 year old clock radio has a backup but my brand new Alexa does not. So every single time we lose power or I have to unplug her to move her, I have to go through the ENTIRE process of putting her back into setup mode, reconnecting her to my wifi. An absolute insufferable pain. Also, she does things for no apparent reason, which again makes me nervous. Normally when idle or not in a set mode, her base black out. Occasionally I will be watching her and she will just begin to pulse a color at the base for random periods of time for no explainable reason. I've asked her to explain herself and she plays dumb. Sometimes a song will come on in shuffle play that I will like and I will ask her afterwards to identify the last song she played. She cannot do this. I ask her to identify the last task I had her perform, she cannot do this. I ask her why she is blinking, she cannot do this. She can adjust her volume up or down one small phase at a time verbally, but mutes the music while executing the command but does not pause it. To go from very quiet to very loud is a process of about 30 seconds, 10 requests, and a starting over of the track. Overall she is limited, does not learn. Little to no AI, and is mostly an exercise in frustration rather than convenience. Another MAJOR design flaw, she cannot be made to respond only to my voice or to refuse a specific voice. We learned this the hard way with my young nephew who spent a good 20 minutes playing hit or miss demanding calls to names he was guessing from my address book and even our local police. A 5 year old is going to stupid things. A 5 year old is going to talk to and play with damn near anything that will play with it.  How in god's name did no one at Amazon think it a good idea to put a ""parent"" or ""owner"" mode where she answers only to my voice, or uses that amazing voice recognition software to single out and restrict a voice. Does anyone at Amazon have children? Or do they simply not like Amazon products either? If you are willing to do things her way, she can be an asset. If you want something that can adapt to and work with you, she's a frustration and a liability. If you want an attractive centerpiece for your livingroom to impress your friends with your ""smart house"", shes perfect. I thought newer would be better. Overall I'm dissapointed with this product and miss my echo dot.\n",81 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
Echo_Dot_5th_Gen_2022_release_With_bigger_vibrant_sound_helpful_routines_and_Alexa,29.99,,,Pizzle,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on October 21, 2022","""UPDATE 3"" - It has some downsides but good overall.","\nFINAL UPDATE!!!If you have a dot already and you're not in a rush to update you're not missing out. The sound quality is better. Like most people I connect my dot to a Bluetooth speaker. So the updated sound quality is mute.The Eero installed mesh wifi is cool if you need to kill a dead zone. Definitely worth it ONLY IF you already have and Eero or plan on getting one. Tech support isn't the best in this department. Read below. When I did get the tech support in the U.S. the knowledge of the Eero wifi was much better. The Tech Support they out source to foreign countries is terrible. They told me the Dot and the Eero don't work together because I didn't buy them together. Amazon was quick to give me a phone call after my review so know that they do read reviews and in good faith will do everything to rectify the problem (A huge plus for Amazon.)So the problem I had was not with the Echo Dot, but with the Eero wifi mesh extender.With the Eero it's all about placement when it comes to these Echo dots. You want your Echo to be in the 5ghz range and NOT the 2.5Ghz. range. Do what you can to get the hub closer. It makes a HUGE difference. I did some digging online and found out that the Eero does well and placed up high also. I purchased a 100 foot cat5 network cable ($17). I Moved the Eero hub to the center of the house. I set it on top of a cabinet. The back room, where I was pulling 5-20mps is up to 432mps download. That's without using the Eero extension on the Echo Dot.The dot has a motion sensor and tempurature sensor that works with my Smartthings Hub. I have not used them because I already have motion and temp sensors in this room that have active scenarios working.I'm going to keep this one and test the sensors a bit more and compare them to ones I have set up already.I would give this four stars but I can't overlook the comedy of foreign tech support. This would've been a frustrating experience if I was pressed to get things working.ANOTHER UPDATE!!!!This junk is going back to the pit of hell it came from. Both of them. It's a good idea but fails in its execution.The Eero built into these are random. Sometimes you connect, sometimes you don't. I could stand a foot away from it and it will not connect to the Eero.This is a BRAND NEW product. If you buy this know that you are part of the BETA TEST crowd. You are the guinea pigs that Amazon is perfecting this on. So you pay your money so they can test this out.On one of my many calls to tech support they told me they only had very little training on these.The old wifi worked better than this.IT IS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME!!!!!!!!  WAIT TILL THEY WORK THE KINKS OUT!!!!New update!!!They don\u2019t know what the hell they are doing at tech support.Stupid stuff I was told.1. It will only work when you buy them together. (The Eero and Echo dot with Eero installed.)Firmware needs to update. \u201cHow do I do that?\u201d I ask. \u201cI escalated the ticket to a higher level tech support.\u201d I hung up. Called back and got a different tech. They told me to update simply tell Alexa,\u201dAlexa, update firmware.\u201d Like I told the other tech, the firmware is updated. Two tech calls ago the guy did it.So now they say they gotta call me back because they need to figure it out. LOL!!!!!STOOOOPID!This gets worse and worse. So now I\u2019m on the phone AGAIN with tech support. This idiot told me the Echo Dot with EERO won\u2019t work with the Eero mesh I purchased because ,\u201dI did not buy them together.\u201d What special kind of stupid is this!! So Eero is putting their name on products that do NOT work with other EERO products. I asked to speak to someone else. I\u2019ve been on hold for 20min.Amazon got something\u2019s right but this is a mess.Tech support has no clue on how to fix this. I\u2019m going to return this crap. But now I want to see how dumb tech support is.They asked which model do I have.There\u2019s only one with EERO in it.She didn\u2019t know that.Ten minutes later and I\u2019m back on the phone with tech support. Signal drops constantly. Tech support no help on this one hot piece of garbage!!!!I spent some time on the phone with tech support. This had to be configured so the Eero would work. I\u2019m getting good download speeds now. I hope it lasts. The sound is a bit of an improvement. More bass and highs. It\u2019s not easy to set up the Eero. They had to. Get inside and configure it to work. A hassle but it works. Tech support for Amazon can\u2019t help. Call the Eero hot line.This won\u2019t even hold the wi-fi signal. My router is the the living-room. The download speeds standing next to the Eero mesh wifi is great. 550mps.In the office I installed the New Echo dot with eero installed for mesh. Without the Echo dot I\u2019m getting 91mps. That\u2019s just off the Eero transmitting from the living room. Better than I expected.Now when I hook the Echo Dot up and I run the test.I get a whopping 0.14 mbps download. I\u2019m sitting a foot away from it.Total garbage.\n",446 people found this helpful,Color: Deep Sea BlueConfiguration: Device only

Works well - but there are bugs - be aware,"\nOk, bugs first: Adaptive listening is a huge problem. It causes Alexa to mis recognize things. For me, telling Alexa to turn on either the Office AC or the bedroom AC caused her to turn on EVERYTHING in the room. BEfore you start giving me suggestions - don't waste your breath. I have already spoke with tech twice and PROVEN that there is a bug in the adaptive listening that causes her to do things she was not asked to do or to NOT do things she was asked to do.Otherwise, it's PERFECT! There are some issues still with other apps that interact with Alexa, but those aren't her fault!Overall, I'm SUPER happy I moved from Google Home devices to the Echo devices!

And it came with this light bulb that I can tell Alexa to dim it to whatever percentage I want to and to turn it on and off whenever I want to which is actually really cool.It would be nice if behind the cloth that in cases this little sphere, that it would display the time and temperature. But at last, it does not, so now I either have to speak out loud and ask Alexa or I have to go get my phone and look at it to see the time. It's trivial but and actually makes a big difference compared to if it did or did not have that feature.They also make it a pain in the butt for the setup procedure. Most people just want to screw the lightbulb in plug in the Alexa and tell it to play music or tell it to tell me the forecast of the day and to set an alarm and to dim a light or turn it off or make it brighter. I don't need 600 questions during the setup procedure. It's like, just let me set it up and get the basics and I can find tune it later. You don't buy a house and then get asked $6,000 things that you want to do to your house and your hopes and dreams for the house. You literally just address those things as they come along while you live at the house. And that's how it should be with this speaker thing. I'm just a man who doesn't have a lot of patience and I acknowledge that, so that's just purely a subjective opinion from an inpatient man that appreciates the sound quality and features of this Amazon Alexa speaker thing\n",One person found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: w/ Philips Bulb

I have three of these devices in three different places around my house, every place has a different temperature yet they all seem to report the same temperature that is NOT an average either so..... what is it measuring then?Sound is where it lacks the most. The sound reproduction is dull, even kind of muffled. If you got it as a BT speaker to actually enjoy music then look somewhere else. I have found that sound is VERY inconsistent between these devices. I have a few echo 3 devices and they sound ""ok"" but one of them has SUPERB sound. It baffles my mind how this can be possible, but there it is.All in all, it is a good device and I recommend it, hence why I keep buying them.

Here's the deal, I originally thought, ""having a screen on the echo that I have in the kitchen will allow me to look at recipes and allow me to see people that ring the doorbell on my blink doorbell!"" But did I ever actually use any of those features? Nope.Now aside from just having extra features that I did not use, I could not stand how many ads would show on the screen regularly. As a parent with toddlers who love to ask about everything they see, the least amount of screens around my house, the better.I enjoy the functionality of Alexa and the integration with my other smart home items, but I'm not sure I'm ready to trade ease of use for ads in my face. As someone who owned the very first Echo that was released, these things have come a long way. The audio quality is by no means killer, but it will definitely serve to play your music or a storybook for your kids with plenty of volume to spare. If you are using the Eero wifi system, this will also serve as a range extender, allowing you to have your other Eero devices in other parts of the house.So in conclusion, unless you are certain that you need another screen in your house, save yourself the money and get this Echo.\n",14 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

(updated 1/12/2023),"\nWe've been using Alexa for years for controlling lights, garage door opener, video doorbell, thermostat, television and streaming!  We are constantly asking Alexa to turn on or off certain lights, or changing light colors, etc.The new gen of Echo Dot has Ultrasound Motion Detection which is a game changer here!  That detection capability can be used to detect motion with adjustable sensitivity and range.  Combined with two new Routines per Echo Dot, one to turn on the lights when motion is sensed and one to turn off lights when there is no motion sensed, we've completely automated lighting in the house.  In the past week I've made the Routines time-based so we can have a brighter white light color during daytimes and a software off white light color as it gets darker outside.So far the only issue with Echo Dot was the placement of all of the Echo Dots.  Here it is very important so we can avoid unnecessary lights going on and off.  It took a week or so to get the combination of placement, motion-detection sensitivity and range dialed in and we are very happy with the results!Now there will be no more fumbling around for light switches when needing a glass of water at night, and no more wasted electric when lights are left on :)  I'm very happy with the Motion Detection features, and it makes a great addition to all of the other features of Alexa's that we use.The one con I've personally faced is now that there are some rooms with more than one Alexa device, the language I used prior with Alexa is ambiguous and she points that out.  That's why I deducted a star.Update 1/12/2023 - One room in the house has a dehumidifier and air purifier and they are running quite often this time of year which generates a constant background noise.  Even with Echo's Ultrasound Motion Detection set to high Sensitivity and Range, I'm finding that I have to snap my fingers or make another noise that is louder than the background noise before the lights are turned on.  However, even with the background noise Echo is able to detect when we leave the room and turns the lights off as expected.  I'm not going to deduct anything from the rating because this makes sense to me, and I believe they'll work this out with a near future updated.Overall I'm still happy with the new generation Echo Dots!\n",33 people found this helpful,Color: Deep Sea BlueConfiguration: Device only

No digital clock, wasn\u2019t expecting it with the darker color option but i don\u2019t think i have met anyone who has not agreed with me that the clock will look much better in the darker color echo. More offset and the matching color combination, even maybe a better contrast making the digital clock light red, orange, or purple? I\u2019m just going to hope that Amazon sees this and uses it, and then all i will want is a new digital version with one of my color ideas. Buy this one for the sound and the 5G connection. I\u2019m having a few issues as I am positive most people can relate. The largest and most frustrating is the combination of speaker environments. I can get this 5th generation echo linked to my 4th generation echo as speakers L and R. They are not able to connect with anything else however. Even if they are disconnected and forgotten from their bond they won\u2019t connect with the other speakers. I speak of one speaker specifically and that\u2019s my top of the line Studio. The greatest speaker, surround sound, Dolby, device hub studio speaker. I\u2019m told over and over that it isn\u2019t compatible with the Alexa devices on network tho can connect with the 2 Sony soundbars I linked together before digital plug in to the TV. Though studio is not able to provide sound for this type of connection. It\u2019s made for a simple audio interfaced system. Preferably the devices that share a name with it\u2026 at a loss.

The added funtionality of the device with onboard motion detection and temperature reading are game changing.  You can set up and endless number of routines for Alexa based on those readings.  I have 4th gen Echos paired with an Echo studio and Echo Show 8 for my sound needs.  I haven't listened to anything on the new dot to tell if the sound is better than the old dot, but my feeling is if you are using an Echo Dot as your main audion input you don't really value sound quality in the first place.  I do think it is in imporvement that the speakers are front firing since most of us have our Echos placed agaisnt a wall.  I'm enjoying all the new things I can make happen with motion detection.  Using a smart plug and space heater and Alexa now you can control room temperature thanks to it's new sensors.  I don't have an eero system but I will probably end up getting one now that when I finish upgrading my Echo Dots I'll have 4 wifi extenders already set-up.

We have a 3rd gen, two 4th gens and 4th gen with clock and now a 5th gen as a gift. All white and charcoal. They are amazing. So helpful when needed, we listen to music daily via pandora or Amazon everyday. Great for homework or instant questions. Got this for my father whom is a doctor working from a home office via telemedicine. This was perfect for him for any questions he may have. He also bought a Samsung QLED smart TV which works with Alexa and I thought this would help him navigate how to use the television more easily. We haven\u2019t hooked anything up just yet, but excited too. The charcoal is nice coloring for his office too. So many possibilities. I have mine in LR  with smart Amazon plug which turned on off my Xmas tree. Will be getting more plugs too. So many possibilities sky is the limit. Love the payment options as well gives an opportunity to get multiple at once as gifts. Also gifted one to my Neice last year the gen white 4 and she loves it,  got same for my brother too . Amazing for all ages. Literally we are 8-78yrs. So compact easy to display. Modern looking. Picks up commands well. Gives weather if requested. Download app to make all your preferences easy and personalize it to just you.  Responds to your voice command. Name it with the small choices it gives. We have an Echo, Alexa, and a Ziggy\u2026 we chose different names for our home so when we command her they all don\u2019t go off at once. We set reminders and errand lists.  I do wish they gave more naming options for this purpose but we are lucky we have enough names for the amount owned. We love them. It\u2019s a cool device and everyone should have one! Makes life so easy at times. The pictures listed are of my white gen 4 clock choice but the gen 5 charcoal looks the same just diff color (this gen 5 doesn\u2019t have clock option) . I believe it\u2019s the software that separates the two. Wanted to give you a picture of what would look like. Connect to your Amazon account and will notify you when your packages come, and any updates regarding your account. As you see mine is lit yellow at the base stating I have a notification.

I was hoping some of the previous kinks in the product may have been worked out with the latest version.My first impressions with the overall sound quality were quite noticeable.  It sounded louder, with more bass and definition than the 3rd Gen, particularly with music streaming (SiriusXM or Spotify)Unfortunately after a few weeks having this, I noticed a couple things that I didn't like.First, many times I can't get it to hear me, or respond to the wake word.  There are times where I must repeat myself several times, or even yell close to the device for it to respond. The responsiveness and ability to properly understand my instructions is actually worse than the 3rd generation Echo Dot.The other significant issue is that the volume level radically changes from barely being able to hear, to being way too loud.  This is particularly noticable when playing my ""Flash Briefing"" where there are many skills in a sequence, going from one news feed or podcast to another.I know that each streaming service may have slight differences in volume levels but this speaker only makes it worse compared to the 3rd generation Echo dot I was using.I suggest Amazon make audio or volume normalizing a priority.  This problem is becoming a huge annoyance as more audio streaming services are being added to the platform.Despite having to delete my voice profile and retrain it several times, voice recognition is more of an issue, being misunderstood, or not heard at all.  My old echo dot 3rd gen was much better in terms of recognition and ability to keep the volume levels more or less at a consistent level.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

We're Alexa-fying our house as a means for dealing with reduced mobility and increased age-related incidents and needs.Yeah, we're really old. And that tempers our overall response to the Gen5 Echo Dot, which could be summed up as ""Meh.""We were perfectly happy with the basic Gen4 Echo Dot but found that when we wanted to add another unit, G4s are no longer sold except as 'refurbished' or 'open box' - plus the G5 intro bundle was really low cost.The Echo platform is exceptionally useful for our applications, which are out of the ordinary if you're young. For example, we've used ""Alexa, turn on all lights"" a couple of times for dark-of-night incidents where light has been a boon backdrop for noodling out various solutions. Light (literally) brightens up your mood when your mood is under you-just-awoke-suddenly pressures.Plus, while our house is quite modest, it's well built and pretty sound-proof, so yelling from the bedroom to the basement office just doesn't cut it. We now have Echos in every key room, so 'Alexa, drop in on everybody' gives us quick access to a house-wide intercom.But now for our disappointment. We actually have some usage for decent music reproduction, and the 3.5mm headphone output on the Gen4 Echo allows us to plug through to ancient but high-quality computer speakers scavenged from local thrift stores.No such plug is on the Gen5. Our cheap music solution is no longer possible. Sure, we could use Bluetooth speakers, but units with sound quality comparable to quality, vintage computer speakers are (a) a lot more expensive and (b) require pairing, which I've always found quirky/intermittent/frustrating with Bluetooth. Because we are really old, simply plugging a stereo jack into a Gen4 receptacle just seems easier and more reliable.And, while I kind of wanted to taste the new, higher Gen5 sound with increased bass, what I'm hearing is clearly designed for boom-a-boom thumpity thump popular music. It probably won't surprise you to find that sounds eagerly sucked up by 15-30 year olds isn't really what ancient folks like us want. Jazz, classical, (dare I say) Enya, even ""Eres Tu"" with its really nice descant at the end -- this is more our range, and it's stuff that requires reined-in bass, un-tinny midrange, and balanced treble.So, between audio engineering decisions and the audio-output de-contenting, for us, Gen5 is not a step up from Gen4.Like all Echos, build quality is outstanding, software capabilities are outstanding -- in fact, incredibly exciting and clearly with few limits -- and the spherical design is minimalistic and very pleasing. It was great that it took nothing more than plugging it in to marry our new G5 unit to all the other Echos dotted around our house. I'm not sorry we added a Gen5 unit, just not jumping for joy.I find myself pigeon-holing it with all the other recent New! New! Product stuff floating out there that offers less, removes wanted accessories, and otherwise pumps up corporate bottom lines at the expense of what (some) owners want.I may come back and add some more praise for the new temperature monitoring some day, but at the moment, we are years away from an Alexa-compatible thermostat...\n",110 people found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only

Not because we are paranoid about being listened to. But because we didn\u2019t think we needed it. Also, we thought there was a monthly charge. We are remodeling an old vet clinic into a home. Now we have need of a way to turn on lights from as many as 4 different doorways. After searching and searching for options, I  started looking at voice activated lighting. First, there is no monthly charge! Second, I thought we would need a bunch of equipment. Wrong there too! We bought one Echo Dot to try it out. The speaker is great for music and podcasts. But best of all, I can use it to control my kitchen ceiling fan/light from any that my Dot can hear me! Smart fixtures are not much more expensive than non smart fixtures, sometimes even cheaper. I love Alexa so much that I am buying more devices for other rooms and I am currently choosing more smart ceiling fans. And, I plan on setting up lights for my parents\u2019 home with voice control for their safety.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
Echo_Dot_5th_Gen_2022_release_With_bigger_vibrant_sound_helpful_routines_and_Alexa,29.99,,,Robert,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on January 30, 2023",Our first step into Alexa world!,"\nThe All-New Echo Dot (5th Gen, 2022 release) is a solid choice for those looking to add a voice-controlled device to their home. The speaker boasts improved sound quality over previous generations, with clear and crisp audio that is perfect for listening to music, podcasts, or audio books. The compact design makes it easy to place the device in any room, and its modern aesthetic fits in well with any decor.One of the standout features of the Echo Dot is its integration with Amazon's Alexa voice assistant. Alexa is user-friendly and has a vast array of skills, from setting reminders and controlling smart home devices to providing information on weather, news, and more. The device also offers seamless integration with popular music streaming services such as Amazon Music, Spotify, and Apple Music.However, there are some areas where the Echo Dot falls short. The built-in microphone array is not as advanced as other smart speakers on the market, which can lead to difficulty in picking up voice commands in noisy environments. Additionally, the speaker doesn't offer the strongest bass response, so it may not be the best option for those looking to play music at high volumes.In conclusion, I would rate the All-New Echo Dot (5th Gen, 2022 release) as a 4-star product. It is a good choice for those looking for a compact and affordable voice-controlled device, but those seeking a high-end smart speaker or superior audio quality may want to look elsewhere. Nevertheless, I would still recommend it for anyone looking to make their home more convenient and efficient.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only
Echo_Dot_5th_Gen_2022_release_With_bigger_vibrant_sound_helpful_routines_and_Alexa,29.99,,,Imatron,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on December 5, 2022",Great update to the Alexa line,"\nWhen you buy an Amazon Alexa device, you are essentially buying a dedicated access device to talk to Amazon's computers over the internet. The device typically only has enough processing power to scan for it's wake word, and then relay what it hears afterwards to Amazon's servers, which then relays the server's response back to your Echo. Even older units like my 2nd gen dot aren't obsolete because they access the same server software as this new model, and won't become obsolete unless Amazon decides to shut those servers down or exclude an older model from service due to a hardware specific security issue.Out of the box, and after linking to an amazon account and punching in some settings, you can set alarms, timers, ask math questions, ask it to spell words for you, ask the time, check the weather, temperature (Indoors and outdoor temps with this model) and quite a bit more. Sometimes I think to myself ""I wonder if it can tell do this for me?"" and a quick question later, I discover a new function. You can further expand it's abilities by linking ""skills"" to your amazon account, which are it's equivalent of a phone app. There are also thousands of gag answers and Easter egg responses, like asking it to beam you up, or fire the torpedos, complete with matching star trek sound effects. It even has the option of asking it to answer to the name ""Computer"" (Ziggy, Echo, Amazon, and Alexa are other names you can ask it to go by at this time).Some skills are as simple as activating them from your phone, or telling the Alexa itself to enable it if you know the skill's name. Some skills need more work and account linking on the PC to set up. Skills can include audio adventure games, podcasts, specific news outlets, music streaming services you've subscribed to. My most used skill is Logitech Harmony, which links it to my Harmony hub IR blaster, a separate device I bought on sale and which allows me to turn my TV on, control it's volume, change input, mute sound, etc.For all that I enjoy about this product, Amazon makes it do SO MANY STUPID IRRITATING THINGS, and many of these issues could be resolved by adding a simple setting to turn it off. Most notable of these irritations, is the inability to turn off it's ""By the way"" messages. Imagine it's 3 am and your having trouble sleeping, and ask it what the time is. All you want is the time, but then Amazon wants you to know that ""Its 3:31pm, by the way Shaquel O'neal thinks-"" and your either issuing an order to shut it up which is itself distracting and annoying, or forced to listen to it further distract you and anyone around you from sleep. Mind you, this is with it's ""brief mode"" turned on, which is supposed to make it less talkative. Amazon also sometimes takes the liberty of adding skills to your account, like some kind of Samuel L Jackson app, and I heart Radio, which makes it fudge the details on some commands like ""Turn off Tron Bulb Delta"" (All my stuff is under the ""Tron"" name, including light bulbs) and mistakes it for a command to ""Play Trombone music"". Until I figured this out and disabled the radio skill, it was a 50/50 nightly occurrence that turning off my light groups to sleep would result in less than helpful music. Although I imagine some of these are intended to train you on it's functionality over time, if I want it to do something, Ill ask it. I don't need it telling me to "" by the way, try saying-"". Whats even more annoying is the fact it will tell you the same suggestions over and over. No Amazon, I don't want you to play white noise for me. You've told me no less than 10 times. I'm sure your proud of your white noise recordings, but I heard you the first time. STOP ASKING ME. DONT ASK ME IN THE FIRST PLACE. And mind you, these are just the annoying issues related to trying to SLEEP with the thing in operation. There is so many other annoying ""by the way"" messages.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

Good customer service.----ORIGINAL REVIEW-----I like the form factor of this Echo Dot but it doesn't seem to respond to the wake word as well as the 2 previous versions (1st Gen and 3rd Gen) that I had.  The audio quality is improved over prior generation of Echos (still doesn't compare to the full Alexa, nor should it be expected to given the size differential).  And it looks a lot better than the prior versions.One downside is that this 5th gen does not come with an aux port, so cannot connect create a wired connection to speakers, as I had done in the past.Don't forget that Amazon has a trade in program for your old Alexa devices, so you can offset the cost of upgrading your Alexa devices.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: w/ Philips Bulb

I haven't had any problem connecting smart devices.  She generally does a good job answering my requests.I am disappointed with some issues with playing Amazon music through the speaker.  Sometimes the music cuts out or stops for no apparent reason.  Sometimes she plays something random and out of the blue that isn't in my Playlist.  But the biggest problem is with loudness normalization.  Each song is either louder or quieter than the previous song.  So I am constantly telling her to ""turn up the volume/turn down the volume"".  It is really annoying.  I have tried finding answers in the app and in the Amazon shopping q&a.  I have received unhelpful answers such as ""change the volume using the buttons in top of the Echo"".  That is even worse than having to request Alexa to turn it up or turn it down all the time.\n",5 people found this helpful,Color: Deep Sea BlueConfiguration: Device only

For many years, I was very happy with the three white 2nd generation Echo dots I had here in my apartment. Thanks to their built in  headphone jacks, I had each of them connected to a pair of Bose mediamate speakers, and they sounded awesome! Everything was working beautifully, but when I heard that the 5th generation dots not only had built in temperature sensors, but also that they came in blue, I couldn't resist. So, I found a new home for my three faithful 2nd generation dots and bought the new deep sea blue ones as soon as they were released this past October.I was disappointed to discover that Amazon had removed the headphone jack on the new dots, but it wasn't the end of the world by any means. After all, these new dots do have significantly better sound. If the loss of the headphone jack was the only issue, I wouldn't be writing this review. I sometimes feel that my old echo dots understood me more clearly and made fewer mistakes, but even that, I can deal with for the most part.My biggest issue with these new dots is an admittedly weird, possibly even eunique one, but it's enough to make me seriously regret my purchase. On my old dots, I used a morning routine from the gallery; I believe it was called ""weather after alarm."" When I dismissed my alarm at 5:00 each weekday, Alexa would say good morning and then tell me the weather. It was a great way to start my day, but unfortunately, it hasn't worked even once since I got these new dots. I've tried every trouble-shooting method under the sun: most of them multiple times, and no matter what, I cannot get a routine to trigger when I dismiss my alarm. I've tried contacting Amazon technical support on numerous occasions, and have only been advised to perform the same trouble shooting steps I've already tried. I know it's a minor issue in the grand scheme of life but it boggles my mind that I can't seem to get anyone at Amazon to help investigate more thoroughly and maybe determine whether or not there's a software bug with the new dots that is causing this issue. I've tried researching this issue on google and youtube, and there just aren't any answers out there, so maybe it is user error, although I have no clue how that's possible at this point.Bottom line: as much as I make use of the feature that will allow Alexa to tell me the indoor temperature, if I had it to do over again, I would have just kept my old dots until they stopped working. My advice would be that if you already have echo devices that are meeting your needs, give the 5th generation dots a hard pass.\n",,Color: Deep Sea BlueConfiguration: Device only

First of all, it's a lot more appealing than the previous model. I love that it's a sphere. And it's still a good product in general for it's main purposes. I mainly use it for adding things for my shopping list, alarms, and music... Which brings me to why I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars.... I truly thought that because this new dot was ""bigger and better"" that the sound would be spectacular and crystal clear. Not saying that it's not good, but it's just not great, which is slightly disappointing considering the price. It isn't very loud at it's highest volume and sometimes it just doesn't sound like the highest quality audio experience. And the bass isn't really bass-ing like I thought it would. It's a good product, I just am judging this purely as a speaker because I mainly use it for listening to music. It is veey responsive tho with it's music commands and I love that you can tap to pause now. One day I'll upgrade to a regular Echo because I just need a loud and excellent audio experience 89% of the time.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

It's an Echo Dot.  This review deals with the Eero built-in capability.  This is the ONLY reason that I upgraded to this Echo Dot (from an older Echo Dot (2nd gen)).  It's in a room where I hoped to improve my connections to a couple of Ring cameras that are on the outside walls of that room.  Well, I hooked it up and rebooted the cameras in question. Hmmm, they did not connect to the new Eero node.  Did some research and found buried in the Eero information for the Echo Dot (5th Gen) that it only communicates on the 5 GHz band.  Welp, Ring cameras communicate on the 2.4 GHz band.  Totally will not work for my need.  Wanted to get this out there for anyone that may be purchasing this new Echo Dot for its built-in Eero.

Thirty minute call to eero support and was then routed to Amazon support for a 1:50 call.  The tech finally escalated it to the second level.  We'll see.  Thanks++++UPDATE++++As a echo speaker, it works GREAT.  However, since this arrived a little more than week ago, I have had 5 calls to eero support and two calls to Alexa support to get this unit to extend my eero network.  The total time on these calls exceeded 7 hours with one being 1:50 and two more at an hour each.Although the dot showed 4 bands of wi-fi signal on the eero app, the final solution provided by eero tech support was that I needed to have this new dot sitting closer (in my case, within 8 feet of my eeco router for it function as an extender).  This left it in a place (closet) that made no sense for a speaker or move my eero router into our guest bathroom.  The idea that it would improve my mesh network by having this dot 8' closer provided no value.It got shipped back to Amazon today and the frustration of wasting so much time will surely fade but not too quickly.New update (12/14/22):  when these went in sale for $25, I felt I'd give up the extender component and just use it as a better speaker than the old Dot.  The new one arrived and did not extend this time either - but after a week (and two updates from eero), I saw it was extending.  So - maybe it's OK if you are willing to deal with some frustration and/or mixed results\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only

Coral,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on October 21, 2022",New temp sensor,"\nUpdate: After using this a little while, also on the desk, I am coming to realize I don't like the round shape with the light ring on the bottom.  I much prefer the light ring on top, like on the Echo 3rd Gen and Echo Studio.  Also, the new tap feature is kind of silly, I doubt many people will use it (hitting a device on its surface without a button feels kind of unnatural.)  As far as the good stuff:Original review:I love the new temp sensor because I can set up routines for my other home automation devices based on the temp in different rooms.  The configurable temp range is from 36F to 95F (above or below).  I also love the motion sensor which was introduced in the previous 4th Gen.Here\u2019s a picture of one that I\u2019m using with it\u2019s built in people detection to automatically turn on the lights in the garage.  It also starts playing the news briefing when it detects motion.  Although the ultrasonic detection only detects major movements and is not as sensitive as a common PIR (infrared) sensor.I don\u2019t care about the built in eero because I use wired backhaul Ubiquiti UniFi access points for all of my WiFi (the only rock solid WiFi setup after I experimented with many).The only minor negatives: 1. the cord should be black, not white, and 2. I prefer the hockey puck shape (with rounded edges) of the 3rd Gen Echo Dot which has the light ring on top.  The low profile shape of the 3rd Gen hides on the desk better and makes it easier to quickly access the top controls.  For this reason I\u2019m only going to upgrade to 5th Gen in locations where I need the motion or temp sensor.\n",74 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

It has better audio quality over-all and more bass than the 4th gen Dot, which I also own. It also has more trebble but less mid-range than the 4th gen Dot. I prefer the audio this new way personally, but you can still adjust the equalizer on the built-in speaker if you want the mids back.One thing to note, this 5th gen Echo Dot has no aux/headphone jack, so if you want to use external speakers you have to use Bluetooth. I think the jack is useful as Bluetooth isn't always 100% reliable and disconnects sometimes. Also some older speakers don't support Bluetooth, so to use them you need a Bluetooth-to-aux adapter. I'd honestly get the older Dot if you just want to add Alexa to external speakers and don't care so much about the quality of the built-in speaker.However the built-in thermometer/temperature sensor is nice, I was able to get the indoor temp just by asking Alexa. This actually isn't the 1st device to include such a sensor, but it's the cheapest to do so thus far. Also the motion detector seems useful but I haven't played around with that feature much.I can't comment on the Wi-Fi extending capabilities because I don't have an Eero system. It would be nice if this device worked to extend other brands of mesh networks or even standalone routers...Over-all if you're looking for a speaker to fill a small to medium-sized space with decent sound on the cheap, this device is for you. But don't expect booming bass or extremely loud music for this price-range. The volume does get loud, but at higher levels it compresses the audio to sound louder while avoiding distortion.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

It is so convenient to add items to my shopping list.  I also use them to convert measurements when I'm cooking, check on the weather in my area and play music and podcasts.  There are so many things you can do with them!  My biggest complaint with the older dots was the sound quality.  I listen to music and podcasts every morning when I'm getting ready for the day.  When I'm in the shower trying to listen, I could not hear my podcasts and I could barely hear my music.  I had my phone and the dot at max volume and couldn't hear it.  When I wasn't in the shower, the sound was very tinny and sounded cheap.  This echo dot's volume and sound is so much better, and I can listen to everything when I'm showering.

Sound isn't bad, will see how it does as part of a multiroom set up, but I have to confess I don't have much luck with multi-room music with the Echoes, it always seems to have issues - I get messages saying it's playing somewhere else but it's not, it cuts out, buffers and just stops or doesn't start at all.I really bought this because it says it has a temperature sensor which I wanted so I can check the temperature where my birds are without having to physically read the thermometer where they are so I can now set up a routine to turn on or off the fans when the temperature is above or below a certain value.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only

Selecting the choice when ordering to have these preconfigured to my account made setup extremely easy.  And they seem to work well, except one thing.  The inside temperature thermometer is not accurate on any of the units.  They all read 2-7 degrees cold, and don't seem to respond much at all to changes in room temperature.  I was sort of looking forward to this feature, but primarily bought the updated units because they were on sale and my old ones were past getting security updates.Although I have Eero mesh routers I have not tried the router extender function on these for two reasons.

I purchased it as I needed to extend my wifi and thought this was a great concept.  Replace an old Dot and get wifi extension for eero without the added device.  Set up was super easy.  The only problem was the Wifi extension would not work for me.  After set up and then getting eero to activate the wifi extension I started getting messages that it would not.  eventually telling me that it was to close to another eero device.  I am in the area of the house signal is week, were I need the extension to exist.  If I moved the device further away into the next area it did connect and worked fine.  Unfortunately that put it into my garage where I did not want this device I need.  Apparently, My house is not that big.  So Ultimately it worked great.  I just couldn't set up the wifi extension as I needed another 10 feet.  So I returned and bought another eero that worked fine and the old Dot still works wonderfully.  Make sure you have enough distance from another erro module for the wifi extension feature to work.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

And it is not accurate enough to mean anything. I was suspicious early on, I would have Alexa tell me the temp when I was cool and when I was extremely hot.Today I got a cheap temperature sensor and I can already tell it is way more accurate than the Echo Dot.

Initially, I purchased the version with a clock for my bedroom, but ended up replacing it with the one without the clock. One reason for this was that the numbers on the clock were too small to see from across the room, and the light emitted by the numbers was a little too blue for sleeping. I moved the clocked version to another room where these issues were not a factor. After using the fifth generation Echo Dot without a clock, I found that the sound quality is good, but not significantly different from my fourth generation Echo Dot once I adjusted the tone settings in the Alexa app. Overall, I am very happy with my fifth generation Echo Dot and would recommend it to others.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

And they still seem like just a toy. And one thing I want to bring out too if you're buying. Alexa, they now decided that they know better than you what you want on your playlist. So if you take your time and set up a playlist for say soft music that you want, Amazon says no. We know better than you. We're going to add songs into it. And if you don't like it, you'll have to pay $7.99 a month from music. Again. It's the big guy beating up on the little guy anyway he can to get more money out of you.

Day 1 [3 days ago] the device would not set up fully, after 2 hours on phone with tech support it fully worked. Hung up and 5 minutes later it stopped working. Since then I have called tech support 5 times but to no avail. One time I was yelled it, twice hung up on, once told Alexa couldn\u2019t do anything but play music, another time was told to call light bulb manufacturer etc. After all this the device is still not fully working!All agents do not listen (except the very first one I spoke with. God, I wish I could talk to her again.  She was AMAZING!  If anyone at Amazon reads this please look up who that was and please have her call me?) Agents are hell bound to have you pair. No matter the issue you WILL pair the device. I told them many times my device is paired and that\u2019s not the problem but it falls on deaf ears.  YOU WILL PAIR.  PAIR AGAIN. PAIR AGAIN. PAIR AGAIN.  PAIR AGAIN. Ad nauseam.  The agents only seem trained to do that one thing and if your issue varies from that script they learned in training they have no clue what to do so, PAIR AGAIN! Finally they admit defeat to themselves then they do their best to get you off the phone; by hanging up or just not talking or, giving you some BS about something irrelevant (eg Firestick, ITunes etc.)  They have \u201cno supervisor\u201d or, they claim to be \u201ca supervisor\u201d which is very doubtful when they didn\u2019t even know there even is a 5th generation or do not know that Alexa can turn lights on /off.Back to the hardware, the 5th Gen constantly turns my IPhone Bluetooth off even though it needs it to work.  An unmentioned  \u201cupgrade\u201d I found on the 5th Gen is when you turn the device on you are forced to hear random music from Amazon music which you can not stop or pause until at least 15-20 seconds elapse.  BTW the \u201cupgrade\u201d to the music occurs every time it turns your Bluetooth off and you must turn it back on, which like I said, mine is doing all the time.The 5th Gen also doesn\u2019t seem to hear as well as the 4th Gen did.  At least 50% of the time when asking Alexa a question I get the response  \u201cI\u2019m having trouble hearing\u201d and I\u2019m only 3 feet from her with no background noise.Regarding sound quality, I am a huge music fan and I only hear a very slight improvement over my 4th Gen, not enough to justify upgrading if music quality is your deciding factor IMO; however; my partner hears a big difference so maybe it depends on music genre (Our preferred genres are polar opposites,)I considered that I may have gotten a \u201cdud\u201d or a \u201clemon\u201d device but Amazon refuses to even consider that because they can \u2018see\u2019 the device online, however to me that only shows the WiFi on the Gen 5 works, but not necessarily all the other functions (ie Bluetooth etc.) but it\u2019s my theory vs Amazon.I really want my 5th Gen to work and to love it as I did my Gen 4 but after 3 days and many frustrating calls I think I may return it and go back to my 4th Gen.I think the 5th Gen could be great but it needs more time in beta testing and/or a complete \u201cdo-over\u201d.  IMO I would advise others to wait until a new version of Gen 5 is available or even Gen 6 is available.\n",18 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

I don\u2019t use my dots as alarms so the tap to snooze function is kind of irrelevant for me. But in the living room the sound is noticeably better (and louder) than the previous generation with richer tones.The only thing that would truly make this superb is if the temperature sensing capabilities were better integrated with other devices (I\u2019m talking to you ecobee!) but then ecobee wouldn\u2019t be able to charge $100 for their sensors anymore.Overall, a good upgrade and it\u2019ll be even better when other devices start to make use of its upgrades too.Also, these would be amazing for surround sound effects IF they worked with the other streaming devices. I find AppleTV 4K has much better performance than the fire 4K so that\u2019s what\u2019s connected to our home theater with fires in the bedrooms.

The jury is still out on the LG voice functionality, but after some bizarrely simple troubleshooting with Amazon support (simply unlinking the fire stick and relinking it, as it said it wasn't connected on Amazon's end) the device launches apps just as it should. At the end of the day, though I remain annoyed with its finickyness, once it's working it works very well.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

Esp. with Amazon music service, I guarantee there are a lot of people who rely on it the same way, and I don't understand why Echoes aren't basically just high quality speakers you can interact with. They're more like an interactive device that happens to have a not great speaker attached.The blue shade is pretty and unexpected for an electronic device, so I was happy with that, but totally underwhelmed by the sound. It's only a hair clearer than my older Echo, but basically no difference - plus there was an annoying fuzzy background noise. Curiously, the Alexa voice volume was not consistent, though that may not be the device's issue.It also shocked me three times as I set it up. I was barefoot on a hard floor so I'm not sure that it was just static electricity. Did I get a wonky one? Quality control is high, but the rare glitch is inevitable, so if so, it's not a big deal. Or maybe the box was dropped in shipping and something came loose.Or maybe it really was just static. The point is that I recognize my experience may not be representative of this item as a whole. Whatever the cause, I was not impressed with the new Echo's performance and returned it.\n",,Color: Deep Sea BlueConfiguration: Device only

A few months ago, I started upgrading some of my old echos and dots for newer models.  Since that time I have had nothing but problems.  They will not stay connected to the network that they are assigned.  I have spent hours trying to fix this problem.  Numerous calls to my internet provider....who sees no reason for this to happen as the bandwidth is good.  Many calls to Amazon always to get someone who knows less than I do...telling me to contact my internet provider.  I have deleted all my saved passwords and tried to reset all the devices multiple times.....yet for some reason they sill remember the password to my other network and jump over to it.  I write this review because I wonder if others are having this issue....there certainly is NO support for this and no other way to report the problem.  For example...one of my new echos has been configured to my 2.4 network (remember I have deleted my passwords to my 5G)......it will be connected tot he 2.4....and a couple hours later it has moved to the 5G.  I believe this is an Amazon problem.  It is interesting that this all started about the time Amazon started laying off echo device personnel.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only

I also connected my vacuum to it which was pretty cool. My main two biggest / three biggest complaints are SoundCloud is not supported on it and the only streaming service I use. I\u2019ve been using it for years because how they treat artists. My second big complaint is UE Boom is not supported either and that\u2019s speaker I use, specifically because of its sound quality. And my third complaint is there\u2019s no internal battery in the dot, I like taking a shower with music, so having to unplug it and plug it back in so I can shower is just a pain in the ass. I can honestly look past one of these things, but all 3 is a complete deal breaker. So now I\u2019m retuning the dot and the light bulbs because they don\u2019t pair with the things already in my life.The pros are Alex is super cool, I like the easy access to alarms, music (Amazon music), info and all sorts of other things and the super plus is waking up with lights\u2026 that part is the coolest because I struggle to wake up in general.But the cons with everything else just makes it not worth it to me to me personally.

One buys a dark color when you want to have a speaker that is not so obvious.  Add a white cord and plug to a dark colored speaker????  Beyond ugly and obvious.  I may just end up wrapping black tape around the cord and plug in an effort to hide the glaringly white cord and plug.This device was replacing a Gen 1 Alexa after getting an updated router that could not connect with Gen 1.  The Alexa App is almost useless if there are challenges to hookups.  I spent way too much time trying to get the ""old"" Alexa to work.  The suggestion that eventually made by Alexa herself was to look at app and manually set up Gen 1.  As hard as I looked, I could not find a link that indicated ""manually connect.""  Problem could be solved by indicating that on first page that lists the different Echo/Alexa devices and indicate Gen 1 has a specific and different setup.All that being said, I have come to appreciate having Alexa - setting timers and alarms, notifications for packages, listening to music, etc.  I also like that Alexa is smaller than the original tower Gen. 1 and has similar quality for acoustics.The new Gen 5 Alexa is working much the same as the old one.  I can't hear a difference in sound quality though the older version had good sound quality as well.  Upgrades are inevitable -- just wish the process was easier and less frustrating.  Hooking up the Gen 5 was easy; working through the problems with Gen 1 were not.  The 3 star rating is for the white cord and for difficulties with the app.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: Deep Sea BlueConfiguration: Device only

I have been able to play the playlists of music I  purchased from Amazon on the Alexa , also purchased from Amazon, with no interruption.. Recently I thought I would relax with  my playlist of 30 songs , only to find out Amazon  does it  again!  All of a sudden.

Absolutely horrible customer service!,"\nI had 13 of these spread through my home as I wanted music throughout my home.  One day only some worked, so I called customer service to help.  SEVEN hours later, being disconnected 3 times and going through the same \u201cproblem solving\u201d tricks sometimes 4 times, I had fewer working than when I started.  7 no longer did more than tell time.  I asked for them to be replaced given Amazon took 7 hours and made the situation much worse.  I was sent an email that said once I ordered and received 7 new ones (nearly $400) I would be issued a refund.When I didn\u2019t get my refund I called to obtain it.  Amazon refused to honor the email that they themselves sent and could read.  In that sequence I was disconnected and LAUGHED at over my insistence that Amazon honor the email I received.  They refused and weren\u2019t even polite about it.  That series of calls was utterly horrible as they were snotty, arrogant thought this was funny and rude and took and additional hour and a half to get no where.  I would NOT have ordered 7 more of these but for the email saying I was going to be refunded the cost of them.Now they want me to return the ones that don\u2019t work or the new ones though the email makes no notice of my obligation to do more than buy more of them in order to get a refund.  Again the email did not obligate me to return anything.  Nor should I have to after 7 exhausting hours on the phone and I was left worse off after dealing with \u201ccustomer service.\u201dIt will take me 2 hours plus gas to get to a place to return either the new Echos or the damaged ones.  Plus they will keep my money for 2+weeks before refunding my $400.So now I own 20 of these things.  7 don\u2019t work.  7 in a box and I already know that customer support likely will not (given I was worse off having called them) make them function nor will they support their products.  Either in actuality or even politely.  So basically 14 of the 20 I have are useless to me ballpark $800.  Plus by the time I get to returning them IF I can as I don\u2019t have time to get to a UPS store I will have nearly 12 hours in this process and I still will not only have fewer working Echos than when I started but the grief, aggravation and rude treatment I have been subjected to.And given they refuse to honor their own emails on this I have zero hope that they will honor any refund I\u2019m due whether I send the new ones back or the 7 I have that don\u2019t work.  I\u2019ve asked that they contact me to resolve this and they have not!At all times I did EVERYTHING Amazon asked me to do.  Whether it was how to fix what I had or get new ones to fix the problem.  Their support staff is incapable of fixing problems and they DO NOT HONOR their OWN emails.  Making their promise my problems.Stay away!!!!!!\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

After receiving it, it appears that the temperature trigger in Alexa only goes down to 35 or 36 degrees.  I needed this to trigger once it gets close to freezing (to turn on a pool pump).I'm not sure if this is a Dot limit (maybe due to its operating temperature limits) or Alexa routine limit, but this was disappointing as there don't appear to be Alexa routine ""temperature"" trigger options other than with the Echo Dot.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

The music distorts on medium levels. I find my old echos (the flatter disc ones) actually do better at the higher volumes. It was awkward showing my husband after selling him on the more expensive model. A real \u201coops!\u201d moment.Maybe it was just mine - but it had me wondering if it was pre-used or rebuilt.

And I absolutely dislike the form factor. It is very prone to triggering on it's own. Just when I'm talking on the phone, not even saying words close to the trigger word. And has frightened me a few times when I talked about a friend who passed and it telling me I need to seek help if I'm feeling depressed. WTF.It has no stereo port jack like my old one did. The previous is now e-waste and I am pretty certain this new one won't last as long as my Gen 2 did.Many features I original bought Alexa for have been downgraded or removed. I use to have it play music from my collection, but now it drops bits and the song breaks up. (Yes I've checked the wifi,  I can stream to laptops and phones just fine.)SInce I have Amazon Smart Switches, I only use it to turn my lights on and off by command and my coffee maker.I'm pretty sure this is the last Echo Dot I'm going to buy.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

Overall, I would not recommend the Echo Dot 5th generation to others due to these issues.In the picture, you can see the Bath echo(4th) shows a echo dot icon, but the Echo dot(5th) shows a wifi device icon.

It had problems from day one and after less than 4 months, completely stopped connecting to the network and uninstalled all Amazon lights that are in the house. Contacted customer service and was told I would need to call back in an hour as tech support needed to figure out the problem. They then told me tech support would be able to call me back as they were very busy but it would take an hour. Over an hour passed with no phone call. Contacted customer support again and it was determined the unit was defective but the window to return had passed, They would send a replacement for the defective item that was purchased NEW, not a refurb. Replacement arrived today with ""Reacondcionado certificado"" plastered across the box as well as another sticker on it. Contacted custom support again and was informed that ""just because I had the protection plan, it does not guarantee I will get a new echo dot. I will get whatever is in the warehouse at the time - refurbished or new. The protection plan is with 3rd party and only covers defective items"". Amazon apparently sells protection plans but does not uphold them, and you are rolling the dice when it comes to what you may get as a replacement for defective electronics. I will only be buying electronics from Best Buy as they actually guarantee what you buy and don't fob off whatever they have in stock.

Sound is weak & setup was (beyond) fraught.,\nThe setup almost made me insane. After permuting all the setup variables over several hours  I was about to send it back when the Bluetooth setup finally worked. My experience with Bluetooth over the years is that it's inherently messed up: setup is usually difficult and often impossible. The user interface was designed by gamers using an 8-bit interface in 1980 and has never been brought into the user friendly zone. Alexa bites off way more than she can chew. She might be okay if she let you drive her but she's a know-it-all who takes charge with all the false assumptions you could imagine.\n,,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

Even worse Amazon has downgraded their music for prime members in that you have to pay for a subscription to listen to music from a specific artist,  Now it always shuffles with different artists you may not want to hear.  There's also no output jack on the 5.  A downgrade all around for me but if your needs are different than mine give it a try.

Never would have wasted my money if I was aware of that. Absolutly shaemful given how the fees keep going up and the service keeps getting worse. Alexa seems to get dummer just like everything on the internet as it's algorythms are washed out by the great dumbing down of the mass culture.

That is another reason why only 3 stars.  This is not compatible with previous battery configurations, and that is not clear in the listing since there is no picture of the back of the unit to compare.  In addition, there is no stereo out port as there has been on all other Echo and Dot devices.

After getting nowhere with Amazon support I decided to return the speaker and get another one, hoping that would work better. Still the same issue. When I paired this with the Echo Studio it caused both devices to constantly skip songs, or just shut off entirely. Not just every once in a while, but every other song! When I play music on the Studio alone there is no issue. When I try playing the group with the Dot and the Studio together the Dot messes up both of them. This is obviously an issue with the new Echo Dot that needs to be fixed. Does anyone know of any other device I can pair with my Studio to have surround sound in my clinic? I am giving up on this new Dot. I would not recommend it at all if you plan on pairing it with another device because it will cause both of them to have an issue.I bought this speaker on Black Friday to pair with the echo studio I have at work. I have been attempting to use it for the past three days. It constantly disconnects from the Internet and will stop playing music, then randomly start playing another song. I have performed a factory reset on both devices at least three times, disconnected and reconnected to the Internet, contacted tech-support, and still nothing. It continues to stop playing songs randomly, or skips to another song.I contacted Amazon support, which was abysmal. After spending an hour talking to someone I finally gave up. I want to return this device and get a replacement. They told me they canceled the replacement and cannot send a new echo for some reason. I told them I wanted to return the original and get a replacement product for it. And they told me they canceled the replacement product and could not send one to me. I am very frustrated because I had high hopes for this new model. The sound quality was decent, but the connectivity was terrible. It disconnected from the Internet every 5 to 10 minutes and I would have to go back into the Alexa app to start playing music again. Even though I paired it with the studio, it would not let me control the devices in the group that I created. I was hoping that maybe there was just a glitch with the one I received and a new one would work better. But apparently the replacement was canceled and they cannot send a new one for some unknown reason. So I will have to go back and buy it at double the price because it is no longer black Friday. So that is frustrating.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only

The customer support people barely speak English and had NO CLUE what I was talking about so I spent 10 minutes of my life answering questions like \u201cis it plugged in?\u201d Instead if someone ACTUALLY PAYING ATTENTION and helping me with the issue!!!My guess is that Echo tech is just not quite there yet.

In the 5 months I've had them, they disconnect all the time and have to be set up again. Changing the default settings (like music) from Amazon music to anything else (I use Spotify) doesn't always work. Sometimes the devices play music on your preferred account, other times it screams that it can't find what you're looking for on Amazon, so it can't play it. As of now, both of my devices can play music if I select them as the current device on Spotify, but they won't recognize my voice at all. The mic is on, it turns blue when I say ""Alexa"", but it quickly stops listening and doesn't respond to a thing I say. I've tried going through all of the reset options recommended by Amazon, and nothing actually works. The Alexa says it is successfully connected to my network, but time after time, it fails to do anything.On a regular day, Alexa either understands what I'm saying clearly, or misses every other word. It seems to change by the hour. I understand hearing the wrong synonym, but it would frequently start responding to things nowhere near what I had asked.If you want a smart device, you're better off sticking with Google.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

But she has started to get some use out of it for music lately. I hate that she cant just pick music she wants to hear. She asks for a song amd it just advertises again and again sometimes about ways she could hear tge song she wants for a subscription to something extra every month. I mean we got Prime and we have the Alexa now along with a thousand amazon purchases each year. So why cant it just play the song she wants from the 60s without me having to add another 20 dollars in fees each month. We tried to just oay tye unlimted music plan to get it for her. But then amazon said, no you gotta have a seperate monthly fee to use your subscription on the alexa device. I mean the T.V. can play the unlimited music app, and my our phones. I can stream it to the home speaker system too and ask alexa on my phone to stream it to the speakers and it works. But my grandma cant do all that extra nonsense. She just wants to hear her songs and wants it to answer 2 questions a week about the weather. And it wont do that unless you pay for an additional service for that 1 device? Seems like a failure on Amazons' part in my opinion. Just saying. Maybe try and stop nickel and diming for digital content when were in a recession.

The sound quality is very good in my home office setting. The biggest thing to think about when buying is are you planning to listen to music all day or leaving it on for the dog while you step out? The problem is Alexa will turn off due to inactivity at random, sometimes 15 minutes, sometimes over an hour after it starts playing. I don't care to have a conversation with Alexa every 15 minutes to keep it from shutting down so a radio might be a better option. Another thing is connecting a blue tooth speaker. It is not possible for the Echo Dot 5th generation internal speaker to be on at the same time you have a paired speaker such as my Bose speaker on in another room. The only work around to having music throughout the house is to buy an Echo Dot for wherever you want music, but then you will still be dealing with the shutting down issue due to inactivity.

I have 1g service and the extender was causing my Eero system to lag and grind.  C\u2019mon Amazon\u2026..This is a bad deal.  You can and should do better, both in tech and in disclosure.Previous review-When I saw Amazon was coming out with a Dot that could serve as an extender for my Eero setup I jumped on it.  What a great idea.  Amazon has done a great job with Alexa products.  They have gotten easier and easier to set up, and in general they work really well.  This 5th Gen Dot also works well but the extender feature had a few wrinkles.  First, when I initially tried to activate the extender feature it immediately popped up an error message which told me I needed to download and update.  That was odd given I preordered the device and have to believe I am one of the first shipments to go out.  No big thing.  I asked Alexa to update the software and in about 30 minutes it was done.  But then, it still balked when I tried to activate the extender.  Same error message.  I asked Alexa to check for updates again, but she said it was up to date.  I tried a few more times, waited a little while, and it finally connected to the Eero system.  However, it then kept cutting in and out.  It was really unstable.  For whatever tech gremlin reason, it finally seems to have settled in and has been holding on to a WiFi signal for a while.  As is often the case with tech, I expect there will be some additional updates.  We'll see.  We'll also wait and see if this thing does, in fact, work well with the Eero system.  If it doesn't, no big thing.  You can turn that feature off and just use it as a normal Dot.  But I hope it does settle in and work well, because I do think it's a great idea and really nice feature.\n",14 people found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only

After Amazon laid off 10k people, most of whom were on the Alexa team, the quality of Alexa has dropped enormously! I think Amazon also shut off a bunch of servers to reduce cost as well, which is the only thing I can think of for the sudden reduced quality. I have searched the internet and have found that a lot of people are having the same issues as me in the last month. Most of the issues that have recently popped up are:1. Roughly half of the time, Alexa can take a very long time to answer. It is somewhere between 5 and 10 seconds.2. Many times I have to ask Alexa multiple times for it to actually respond.3. Most of the time, the response has nothing at all to do with the question asked so I have to rephrase the question. Sometimes it takes three to five times to rephrase the question. If after the fifth time it doesn't work, I just give up.4. If you own multiple Alexas, there has always been a problem of asking Alexa a question, and it responds on a completely different Alexa. It seems to have gotten much worse lately.I feel like Amazon has given up on Alexa, so it is a sinking ship. I am looking at what other product I can use to replace it with, but am hesitant to go with the other two major brands because they could decide to do the same thing at any point.

My main reasons for upgrading to this 5th gen model were for the compatibility promised with eero as an extender and as a Ring bridge for my security system.The Eero connectivity and bridge functionality seem to work fine on this device, however it seems to struggle significantly with basic smart home tasks like operating plugs, switches, and lights on command. when asked to turn on or off a light, this device frequently says ""device"" doesn't support that. However i simply walk over to an older echo device and repeat the command, and that device has no problem performing the action.I'm no network expert but my guess is that this device, which operates on the 5ghz band, does not have proper firmware/software compatibility updates to function seamlessly with smart home items on the 2.4ghz bands. Thus far I haven't been able to find any good solutions to the issue so I'm on the verge of returning the item and sticking with the old Gen 2 device i was using previously.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only

My last ""Dot"" had a 3.5 mm auxiliary out, which means I could upgrade my old stereo with a single cord. Now I have an old stereo, with voice recognition! It's awesome.This ""Dot"" (5th Gen) has NO OUTPUT AT ALL... Just the power cable.Weirdly enough, the most recent echo has an auxiliary out, as I just found out. Whereas the first generation echo had no auxiliary out, but the first generation Dots DO...When I bought the echo and it didn't have an auxiliary out, I figured it was in beta, and it was a beta thing. When I needed to futurize an old stereo, the Dot did the trick.So when I needed another Dot... I didn't even bother to check if it had a 3.5 mm jack. I'll admit, that's on me, buyer beware. However, I think it would have been helpful to be a little bit more prominent about changes to your products. That way when you go back to buy the product again, you get what you expect, unless it's changed and notated.So I guess the new Echo you plug into your old stereo? While the new Dots, act like standalones like the Echo used to?Still can't get my Amazon Tap (which is an official Echo device) to play with my other Echo devices.Sometimes I can't even get the first generation echo to work with the third generation Dot... Did the internet change or something? The answer is no. Come on Jeff.I can't get the Sonos to work with other Echo speakers, because it's just ""Alexa enabled"" . Wtf Jeff wtf. Why would you buy a satellite speaker like Sonos, that has Alexa, that doesn't work with any other Alexa products, even though they're on the same darn network?

I bought this newest version for only one reason: the Room Temperature Sensor.Here in New England, my kitchen is always slightly colder than the rest of downstairs. I could have bought a Nest Sensor, but replacing my kitchen fit with this version would make it a multi-tasker.Except - IT DOESN'T WORK. It reads 56F constantly. The room, measured by any other thermometer is actually 64F.When I called Echo support, they told me they've received *many* complaints about this, and were just sending out replacements. Sure enough, a new dot arrived the next day. Set it up, waited 24 hours, and.... 56F!Amazon, this was a great idea. Really. Great. But the execution simply doesn't work. True, the sound is nicer than my other dots - and if I were using it as a music speaker That might prove useful. But until you fix this feature so that what you're selling works...This Dot version is not ready for Prime Time. Fail and Return.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only

The sound is way better for one, BUT it is also a totally redundant piece of junk at the same time, unless you want to invest $120/year to make it worthwhile, which also makes it one of the worst investments you can make.Allow me to explain something which many people already have already realised: A lot of people use this for kitchen timers, weather reports and maybe the occasional fact from Wikipedia, but most people who buy this will want it for an upgrade for sound quality for Amazon Music, and this is where I consider this thing junk.Without any consultation, Amazon have decided to allow normal Prime users full access to the WHOLE 10 (or is it 100?) million song library, with a small catch. You can no longer listen to what you ACTUALLY want to listen to, you have to listen to a shuffle of 1 or 2 songs you want to hear, plus all the random junk in that 10/100 million playlist, and that's a lot of junk.You can no longer listen to your albums you bought WITHOUT shuffle, you can no longer listen to ANY album without shuffle, and you now have to listen to totally random nonsense too. If you used to use Alexa to give your kids a lullaby to go to sleep, they might also get some Sex Pistols mixed in. Sweet Dreams !!UNLESS, you upgrade to unlimited - only $120/year - some would consider that a bargain for a peaceful nights sleep, but considering it was part of Prime but is now locked behind a paywall, I personally have a different view.1 star is all you're getting for this blatant money-grab and betrayal of customer trust !\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

Support Service with Amazon, has much to be desired","\nThe device itself, when it works, is great. I have several Alexa devices and love them all. I bought this version of the dot for Christmas on 12/18/22. It was setup and working post holiday until 4/17/23. The device itself will not hold connection to to wifi. I have completed every connection method, rest, hard rest, etc. I have called customer service on 4/21/23 and was told it was outside of the return period so there is nothing that could be done. I would hope the life span of the 5th generation dot would be longer than a 1st gen dot I am still using, but it appears not. I would also hope that Amazon would stand behind product quality and make good on the malfunctioning device, but that does not appear to be the case either.In summary, device is great when working.

My 3rd gen echo dot responds correctly from another room when I expect this one to respond. Thinking about switching to Google home devices amazon needs to step it up.Update: After posting this review someone reached out telling me to try changing the wake word. Then they told me they'd send an email to me I could respond to if that didn't help since it was still under warranty. I responded to the email telling them that didn't help.

My Echo ran a firmware update immediately. I then was asked to update EERO, both updates ran smoothly. I then launched the EERO app and turned on Eero built in. I keep getting error message to check for software update. Already done !  I have jacked with this for over 3 hours. I rebooted Echo and eero and even my modem  The only way to get the error to go away is turn off eero built in. The only reason I bought this junk is to extend WIFI. I recently received ASTRO and have already had issues with that. Not happy Amazon customer.  ****This appears to be a problem with EERO and not the dot. I have an open work order with them to troubleshoot the issue. We were not able to get it working though my initial call. Tam from Amazon was amazing  thanks for caring.

The device is compact, easy to set up, and has a sleek modern design that fits perfectly into any room.One of the standout features of the Echo Dot is its voice control capabilities. With Amazon's virtual assistant, Alexa, I can control my smart home devices, play music, and get answers to my questions simply by using my voice. It's a convenient and hassle-free way to stay connected and in control of my home. For example, I can turn off the lights in my bedroom or adjust the thermostat without ever having to leave my couch. I can also ask Alexa to play my favorite playlist or set a timer for when I'm cooking dinner. The options are endless and it's amazing how much easier it has made my daily routine.In addition to its voice control capabilities, the Echo Dot also has impressive sound quality. It's clear and crisp, making it perfect for streaming music or listening to audiobooks. I particularly love using it to listen to podcasts or music while I'm working or relaxing at home.Overall, I highly recommend the All-New Echo Dot (5th Gen) to anyone looking to upgrade their smart home or add voice control to their home. It's a game-changing device that I use on a daily basis and has made my life so much more convenient. The setup process is a breeze and the device is very user-friendly, so even if you're not tech-savvy, you'll have no problem getting it up and running. If you're on the fence about purchasing the Echo Dot, I can confidently say that it's worth the investment. You won't be disappointed!\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only

First of all, we already have one Alexa in the house that belongs to my 16 year old son and he mostly uses it for listening to music and controlling his bluetooth LED lights and lightbulb in his room! My daughter didn't ask for the Alexa, but since she does have the bluetooth lights in her room, I figured she may enjoy being able to do voice control commands like her brother. I also ordered her a bluetooth lighbulb for her ceiling fan that works with Alexa! She has had an absolute blast controlling the lights in her room; the bulb I ordered can do every possible shade of color under the Sun...so my daughter is literally in her room like, ""Alexa change my light to hot pink...Alexa change my light to beige..."" It is SO cool! When she can't sleep, she simply says, ""Alexa play meditative storm sounds"" and Alexa replies with her options... for FREE of course! We can also ask her to read my daughter a bedtime story and she reads a story. Her Dad and I even creeped by her room and said really loud, ""Alexa, play ZZ TOP!"" just to annoy her lmao It's been so much fun and Alexa, like Siri, can answer just about any question or complete just about any task you ask of her.

If you raise the sound above 7 or 8, whatever software adjustments they made to the sound output cause the music to ""pop"" - and not in the good way.  More along the lines of ""this speaker wasn't meant to output this level of sound"".Maybe the above doesn't matter to you, and that's fine.  The 5th gen has some things you might want, like temperature sensor or the ability for it to tell when you enter a room (though that's a bit creepy - can we opt-out of that data collection?).  For me, the lack of an audio jack means you have to deal with the latency in the bluetooth audio experienced with some improperly calibrated bluetooth speakers.

The voice recognition is downright terrible, often you have to yell at it because if you have the volume up louder than 4(goes to 10), it can't hear you over it's own audio, you have to stand right in front of the device and yell at it to get it to listen to you. Google doesn't have this issue, you can whisper to Google while it's at full volume from across the room, and it will still hear you.If you have more than one device integrated into your home, be prepared to expect commands worse than talking to a toddler. I have a speaker in my kitchen, and one in my living room. If I want to pause amazon music in the kitchen after cooking, and transfer the music over to my living room to eat, forget it. I've only gotten this feature to ever work twice, all the other times, it will revert to whatever music was played last on that particular speaker.In short, I'm completely baffled as to why Amazon doesn't invest more time into these smart speakers, they could be phenomenal, but, instead Amazon only invests money on the data mining aspect of the devices, as Alexa is CONSTANTLY making suggestions of what you should buy on Amazon, ex: you are talking about dishes with a friend in your house, MAGICALLY suggested Amazon purchases are a bunch of dishes on your phone/computer. I 100% honestly wouldn't even care about this complete invasion of privacy, if the devices actually worked somewhat okay. The one and only reason we've kept them is because they were a wedding gift, and that's pretty much it, they suck. They never understand you, they answer your questions poorly, they get confused and then ask you more questions, and still can't figure out how to respond to your first question.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

Or when it does work sure enough a week later an update will break the feature.It never plays music and constantly unlinks spotify and apple music accounts.Forgets where podcasts last stopped.To play a specific song although I have spotify or apple music as the main music app in the echo app settings is just never possible.

Like what is the point of having those options there for years and never gotten around to making it work?Its inconceivably bad how even within its echo/amazon eco system it CAN'T carry out tasks consistently. The echo to firestick which you would assume be something that they would have streamlined to be functional. Ooooh you can guarantee that 95% of the time it will not do that or push something else such as buying a movie or tv series to be bought on prime video smh. It will pull you out of an app your using like youtube example given belowThe simplest things like ""search (youtube channel name) on youtube"" as an example command, to a linked firestick is just not doable everything has to be typed out practically on your remote.The point of having an echo is just to be a glorified alarm clock. Which even that can be annoying if the volume is to loud. It won't hear you say the wake work ""echo"" and then say ""stop alarm"".

Now I'm sorry I did.  After the recent Alexa ""upgrade,"" Amazon devices will no longer play albums or playlists of music that HAS BEEN PURCHASED FROM AMAZON. All that work creating playlists of music for relaxation, sleep, exercise, and favorite artists in various groupings, all of that is suddenly GONE from the Alexa service. Likewise, if one requests to hear an album that is in MY library purchased from Amazon, she insists on saying that she is going to shuffle other music by ""similar artists"" along with my albums that I DO NOT want to listen to and ignores my playlists completely. Mind you, these are requests for music purchased from Amazon. Just saying that again so it's clear. Then, when making a music request, Alexa frequently makes one listen to long ads for buying her expensive music service . You know, if you request to hear your music, you really want to hear that and not the same annoying ad you've heard a million times about a product you will never buy, and then some random music you didn't request. I loved being able to listen to my music just by asking for it and have purchased Echo devices for almost every room in the house. Now that I can't do that anymore, all those hardware and music purchases seem very much like bait-and-switch to me and I feel very ripped off.  Now I would feel bad about buying this as a gift, since I assume it would have the same sad behavior I experience at home and just provide irritation.

As far as the Echo smart speakers, I love them. They sound great on their own or paired together in a stereo configuration(much better). To have synchronized sound throughout the entire house as easy as this is just awesome. Having smart lights and plugs, everything is voice controlled. Even my smart TV since it\u2019s Alexa ready. After I updated my software, since I kind of forgot I had those old dot\u2019s, everything set themselves up on their own. I of course had to tell them what room they were in. It wasn\u2019t hard to set up my house and now it\u2019s all voice activated. The upgrade to high def digital sound in Amazon Music is a must, you will be able to hear the difference. Since I got my gen 2 dot\u2019s, which were a pain in the a@# to control my lights by voice and music only sounded good through my stereo, they have greatly improved. You can get an Echo, not the dot, for 50 bucks on sale. It\u2019s comparable to something worth 3 or 4 times that. The gen 5 dot sounds great in a smaller room. Good base for such a little thing. The 4th gens were good but the 5th is a little clearer and deeper.\n",,Color: Deep Sea BlueConfiguration: Device only

This was also the case with the previous version)The new Echo Dot 5 is visually very similar to the 4th gen version from 2020, but these are some nice functionality improvements.-The speakers have been upgraded, now with more focus on low end and bass volume.  I have tested out a few different types of music, and I would agree that there is noticeable improvement, but really the speaker is still too small to be very impressive.  The sound is not even close to a regular Echo device, let alone higher quality speakers.  I appreciate the improvement here, but I still wouldn\u2019t choose to listen to music on these on a regular basis, especially at high volume where there is a bit of distortion.-I like the ability to be able to trigger routines based on temperature and motion, and stopping alarms by tapping is also a nice feature.  These additions offer many more useful automation options, and now having multiple Echo devices with temperature sensors can help identify differences in room temperature throughout the house.-The Eero Wi-Fi extender ability could actually be very useful for some people that need to extend the range of their network.  This was easy to configure with the Eero app, and it seems to be working well so far.Overall, this is a nice little upgrade from the previous version.  The speaker/sound improvement is nice, but not the biggest deal since these Echo Dots are still not the best choice for high volume music.  The sensors and Eero extender features are the biggest improvements, and these changes add so much extra functionality to an already useful smart speaker.  The lack of an audio-out port is the only downgrade, but that might be important to some people.  I also wish they included different color power adapters and cables, but that is also not the biggest deal.  I will be grabbing a few of these new Dots, since the Eero Built-In will come in handy for certain places we need to extend coverage.\n",27 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

At some point, after ""The A-Queen"" pissed me off for the last time (we've all been there!), I made the move to the Google eco-system. And life was good for a long time. In the meantime, I watched Amazon continue to invest in new products and new features. But Google was doing what I wanted and I continued to invest in their hardware. However, at some point Google engineers decided that we all wanted to hear more from our smart devices. Commands that used to simply prompt a ""ding"" at some point became "" Got it! Playing (artist) from your Google playlist on Kitchen Music"". And when you simply wanted to pause or stop, it was the same thing: "" Got it! Stopping music on Kitchen Music"". So like if someone called on the phone while music was playing you had to wait till ""G-Man"" was done spouting off to answer. Or changing music during a party with voice command literally became embarrassing. Going online it turns out a lot of people complain about this and Google simply chooses to turn a deaf ear to these complaints. This year (2022) I decided to look at the new Echo eco-system. So for Black Friday I ordered the new Dot v5 to make the comparison. Well, much to my pleasure, Amozon has decided that less is more. When I ask Alexa to stop playing music I am met with a simple ""ding!"".  How refreshing! So... not looking good Google! At the same time my house is solar powered so I've bee changing my house over to electric heating (from oil). This presents a huge opportunity to employ smart home technology to conserve energy. Well, turns out Amazon has LEAPT out in front of Google in features. Temp sensors?! Motion detection?! Wow! And low and behold it all works! Actually, move beyond smart thermostats. Imagine filling your house with speakers and being able to create a new heating zone with each one. I use Lutron Caseta hardware. Their switches integrate perfectly with Alexa. Learn how to wire in a relay and voila! the possibilities are pretty extensive. Google is so far behind on this stuff, they're stuck in the ""we can answer more questions"" mode. Well, Hello Amazon! Sorry you lost $10 Billion dollars last year. I promise going forward I'll be helping you get some of it back (lol). And to Google: sorry you couldn't learn that less can be more. Your loss!\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only

Sounds good, better than Dot 4. Nice to link them together to play music in multiple rooms at the same time. Dislike that the light keeps swirling and rotating during the night, so I have to unplug it every night. Wish I could have been able to turn it off but haven't figured it out yet. Wanted to use it to listen to nice music to go to sleep to or wake up to. Had some difficulties with getting it to work, but Amazon tech support was very good. Wish there would be a list of typed commands, because guessing them is not working for me. At times both dots need upgrades and they do not perform until you call someone and sit on the phone for an hour or so to upgrade it and get it reset. That's bad. It's happened at least four times in less than a year with Dot 4. Hopefully I don't have to keep calling them back to get it to respond. At times, having to repeat myself over and over different manners before it recognizes what it's supposed to do. It's because I can't get a typed list of appropriate commands from anyone. I am not a computer techie, And finally got my first smartphone a year ago,so it's frustrating. You have to have an app on your smartphone to set them up and make them work, or to change settings, alarms, etc. Again, wish there was some printed literature somewhere or even online but I have been told by Amazon techs there is nothing. With constantly changing technology, it seems like they would put something out. Love the idea that I can plug it in outside and play music instead of bringing my giant boombox outside in the summer.

I review with information I feel others would like/need to know about the product as I assume my review may influence the purchase. I always try to go above and beyond surface characteristics and input into quality, value, and application. Most importantly, I end each review with an answer as to whether I'd purchase the product again which I believe is the most critical question pertaining to the item. To manufacturers: Want me to review your items, drop me a message!I resisted the temptation to add any smart home assistants like Alexa until the technology matured and came down in price. I'm glad I waited and I've just started setting up my smart home.I started with the 5th Gen Echo Dot and recently added a second to my upstairs office. Installation was a breeze and I filled out most of the needed information before it/they even arrived. By doing so, you can have it attach to your Wifi network as just after it powers-on for the first time.We've been having a lot of fun with them and I could see adding one more in the bedroom or our workout/zen room. We use it for morning news, music, general information, etc. Our favorite feature is probably the intercom which allows us to open up a conversation between floors so we can have a discussion without needing to go upstairs/downstairs all the time. The announcement features are fun as well, like announcing dinner is ready.As would be expected, additional power with Alexa is unlocked when you add your Alexa-capable devices attached. I also recently purchased smart light switches that can be controlled through Alexa to turn on/off the lights, set up activities/shedules, etc., in addition to adding some of my LED lights and my Nest thermostat.The speaker is upgraded in this generation and while I haven't tried the gen 4 or previous unity for comparison, the small built-in speaker has good tonality with a good balance of treble/bass, which can be adjusted. The sensitivity of the unit when you say ""Alexa"" is astoundingly good. A lot of little features built in you wouldn't know about if you didn't get the ongoing tips and tricks. We are finding new things you can do almost every day.The only criticism(s) I have is that I wish in came in different colors and that the power cords would match the unit itself. I purchase the black ones and they come with a white cord. It's fine ... after you get used to it.At the $50 price tag, it's easy to provide the interface in your home to pull all your smart devices together for control and for features to make your life easier or, at least, more efficient. I could see how adding other Alexa-aware smart devices could be addictive.I would purchase this product again without question, and already did in fact.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

Supposed to be easy enough a child could figure it out not really. I spent 40 minutes trying to get it to work. Still won't play amazon music to my phone. Just a disappointment that I have to ask other friends for help cause its not simple. Nothing is simple and someone has to show you how to do something. Get an echo dot it helps life. If it doesn't want to connect to the device and I have to jump through hoops?? Please my free amazon music is going to waste cause your product that its suppose to play won't connect. So update. No good answers to questions and issues with Alexa following the basic commands. They play and they sound great but it\u2019s not work the way they say it should.

I'm old school & don't need a robot to shut off my TV or lights or make a grocery list for me. What I got this for was to tell Alexa to play my favorite types of music, ask the time, weather or ask about restaurants. That's it. I'm happy it does all of those perfectly. It was a bit frustrating to get it going from my phone. But, my husband got it done for me faster. The sound quality is nothing to rave about. I had it turned up with some pop music & it was just ok for me. I'm Gen X & most of us know about loud music and good quality sound. This has none of them. But overall it serves the purposes I got it for. I can shut my own lights off, tv etc. Hell I don't even want an electric car where the gov can shut off our cars if we don't do what they say in the future.

However I feel like the Echo Dot 5th Gen can pick up my voice better than the 3rd Gen when loud music is playing, which I love because I struggled with having to yell or manually turn the volume down for it to recognize me. What the 5th Gen makes up for in clarity when compared to the 3rd Gen, the 5th Gen does not produce as loud of a sound when playing music. Regardless, one feature I love is that you are able to connect this to other Echo Dots in your home for a ""surround sound"" experience.

After setting it up, answering a lot of questions about privacy and demonstrating some of the things it can do their attitudes changed to cautious curiosity.  As I write this review one day later I doubt I could pry this away from them if I tried!  They are loving it!Setup was very easy as long as you have a smartphone with the alexa app installed.  I did run into an initial wifi setup issue which was resolved simply by resetting the Alexa dot. Pairing the dot to 2 smart plugs was trivial and only took a couple of minutes.  Voice recognition was excellent even before running the customization routine.The sound on this device is outstanding!  One of the main reasons I bought it was so my mom could play music for my dad who has dementia. Quite frankly I was blown away by how good this thing sounds!  Think home theater quality...All in all I would highly recommend this Alexa dot!  If you are buying it for someone who is technology shy you will need to set it up for them and walk them through how to use it as the experience could be somewhat overwhelming otherwise.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

As someone who isn't super tech-savvy, I was worried about setting it up and using all the features, but it was actually super easy and user-friendly.The voice control is definitely the standout feature for me. It's so convenient to be able to control my smart home devices and play music just by talking to the Echo Dot. And Alexa is pretty good at understanding what I'm saying, too. The sound quality is also really good for such a small speaker. I've been using it to listen to music and podcasts and it sounds great.I also really appreciate the sleek design of the Echo Dot. It's small and discreet, so it doesn't take up much space and fits in well with my home decor. The built-in speaker is a nice touch, too. I don't have a home phone, so it's been really handy to be able to make and receive calls with the Echo Dot.Overall, I'm really happy with my purchase. The Echo Dot is a great value for the price and has made my life a lot easier and more convenient.

I tried replacing it earlier with a prior version of this globe shaped one, which didn't work as well for me.This newer one has much better sound quality than either of the earlier ones. It has the added benefit of knowing the temperature. The limitation is that the Alexa app won't allow me to issue multiple separate commands in a routine. It will let you connect several with ""and"" but there's a low limit for the length of a command. So I couldn't have an Alexa routine that told me the temperatures in multiple places very well.It also adds Eero, which I don't use, but since the price didn't go up, it's nice to have something that might be handy in the future.\n",,Color: Deep Sea BlueConfiguration: Device only

I am unsure how to best use Alexa, other than to play music, ask for the temperature, tell me terrible jokes, or just whisper to her to hear her whisper back. I will find new and crazy things. But best of all...the speaker sound is tremendous! I look forward to being assigned my personal NSA, FBI, or CIA agent! Which one will it be? It's an adventure! ;)\n",One person found this helpful,Color: Deep Sea BlueConfiguration: Device only

Very surprising range for such a small speaker. I am so sold on these echo dots and have to travel between three locations where i maintain an apartment and two homes and I don't have to get expensive sound systems to enjoy my music.  Plus, it's so easy to control the lights from anywhere which is a real plus for me coming into different places and not having to worry about ""where am I and where is the light switch.""\n",One person found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only
