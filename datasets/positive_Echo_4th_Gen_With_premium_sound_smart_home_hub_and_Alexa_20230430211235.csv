Echo_4th_Gen_With_premium_sound_smart_home_hub_and_Alexa,61.76,,,SubieNewbie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on April 6, 2021",HONEST REVIEW/COMPARISON FOR ALL INTELLIGENT LIFE FORMS.,"\nThis is an honest review and comparison of the new 4th Generation Echo (not Dot) vs. the 2nd Generation Echo Plus (the last Echo Plus that was launched with the 3td Generation Echo).I actually purchased two 4th Gen Echoes to create a Home Theater Group with the FireTV Stick 4k latest variant. I'll include notes about that as well.Sound Quality Pros: I really enjoy music from different genres and I like to tinker with equalizer settings so that I get the fullest sound out of even a cheap speaker. I also like when a speaker(s) can pull double duty as a surround sound system for my television as well. That's what attracted me to the new Echoes.Regarding music streaming from Amazon Music HD, I must say the sound is really smooth and crisp. I adjusted the equalizer settings for the individual devices in the Alexa app to boost the mid most, followed closely by the treble and a moderate bass setting (if they are paired in a stereo pair or Home Theater, adjusting one device automatically adjusts the other). I have my Echoes placed about 12 feet away in front of  my primary seating spot on the sofa and the are spaced about 8 feet apart flanking the television. They are situated about 4 feet off the ground on book shelves.  This positioning has been perfect for the accoustics in my 15x18 living room with tall ceilings. The speakers really fill up the space. And I am most impressed with how the sound bounces off of the walls and truly feel as if it surrounds me and immerses my eardrums into it.This holds even more true for when I watch a movie with the Dolby Atmos setting on. I can hear the channels fairly well and it really seems like I own my own private movie theater in my living room. There's been times that there's a sound affect so specific to one channel and reproduced so clearly that I've actually muted the show thinking that I was hearing some noise from outside or in the hallway of my apartment building.These two devices together get pretty loud without any noticeable distortion. Now I haven't played much bass heavy music but I do love action and sci-fi movies that are sound effect laden and peppered with bass booming explosions etc. The new 4th Gen Echoes keep up very nicely.In contrast, though I thought I really loved the Echo Plus 2nd Gen, I now find that I really can't enjoy music or movies as much on it. I think that this is because the main speaker fires downward and the rest of the sound is omni directional. This sounds good on paper but in practice, at least for my uses, that type of speaker just seems muffled and really a waste of sound waves. Let me explain. How often to you place the Echo device in the center of a room to benefit from an omni-directional speaker? Most people don't have floor outlets under their coffee tables so it sits on an end table or bookshelf. It's usual home in a bedroom is on the end table. Even in a kitchen, unless placed on the island, the Echo rests with it's back to a wall. So, why then, would you want (let's say) 40% of the sound waves to be directed to a big slab with no ears to appreciate it?The directional sound setup of the new Echo 4th Gen is ideal, really, for it's positioning in most homes. Sound is really diminished if you are behind it or immediately to it's side but comes barrelling at your ear drums when you are any angle in front of it. It's louder, more clear, and much more advanced when it comes to being able to utilize Dolby Atmos playback. I definitely choose the 4th gen over the 2nd Gen Plus any day. I almost feel bad for unloading the Plus onto my parents when I bought the 4th Gen. I'll upgrade them this Christmas. Lol.The omni-directional speaker would be a benefit if it were placed in the center of a patio for a gathering or party, but again, where's your outlets? Not in the middle of the concrete or deck floor. So chances are, even on the patio, it will be placed backing up to an exterior wall. So the myth of the omni-directional speaker advantage is busted in my book.Voice Recognition:At first, I felt there was a noticeable difference with the Plus having the upper hand when I comes to summoning Alexa. However, I believe there have been some fairly large software updates recently that included fine tuning adjustments to the mics on the 4th Gen devices. They now clearly pick up my questions or commands from across the room and quickly cancel out the other Echo Dot I have on the far side open floor plan nearest the kitchen. Before, with the Plus, it was a toss up as to which one would respond because I firmly believe the best mics are still on the Echo Dot 3rd Gen with clock variant. Hands down. If only the echo show 5 in my bedroom would be even half as good, I'd be happy ( that unit is by far the worst with just 2 lack luster mics vs the 4 on the Dot and Plus).Alexa is also quicker to respond on the 4th Gen too. Now that's a combination of the 450-ish gbps internet speed I am fortunate enough to have but I understand it's also due to a better processor and improved software.And let me just say one thing... I don't know anyone who buys their smart home devices with  Zigbee compatibility being the #1 consideration.  Who cares? I have bought the best reviewed for the price smart bulbs, TV, and plugs etc not giving a thought to Zigbee because the latest generation smart devices don't require a hub.All of my smart home devices work just fine by enabling the skill on the Alexa app with that of the manufacturer's chosen app and linking the accounts. The biggest issue I have is trying to remember what I named each lamp and group to turn on and off the lights. First world problems, I know.For what it's worth, the big 3 smart home apps which seems to be used by these el cheapo devices are Kasa, Govee, and Smart Life. I have devices on all three and the Alexa integration is seemless. Except the darn ceiling fan speed control. Still haven't completely figured that one out entirely.Setting up the devices and Grouping:Both the Echo Plus and 4th Gens are very easy to set up initially. The Alexa app, though not entirely user friendly regarding the UI, does all the work and guides you through the process fairly quickly. The oddball thing that's a bit more challenging is knowing what the difference is between a stereo pair, a home theater and a speaker group.First, a stereo pair must be two identical models (I believe an Echo Sub woofer can be added as the one off) and the pairing is only for music streaming. Only one Echo will respond at a time when you are conversationally interacting with Alexa.In a Home Theater grouping, one or more Echo devices of the same model can be joined with a FireTV device such as the Stick 4k. A sub can also be added. The crummy part at first, is that you can't include your existing sound bar into this Home Theater Group. Amazon devices only, folks. So you must choose which you want to listen to.Now, I'm not horribly disappointed because the sound quality of the two 4th Gens on each side of the TV is really great so the sound bar isn't needed but I hate the thought of the wasted money sitting 32 inches wide in front of me producing no sound at all.IF, you have a smart TV like a Vizio, there is a way to activate the sound bar and have the Amazon Home Theater working at the same time. And here it is: the sound bar must be hooked up to an optical cable and the audio setting on the TV must be set to PCM not automatic. Auto defaults to whatever device you are streaming on ie a FireTV Stick. Then, while playing your FireTV Stick, choose the Home Theater as your audio source on the Fire TV menu. So in essence, the TV thinks it must send sound to the sound bar only while the Stick thinks it should be using the Home Theater. Through whatever glitch, I now have all three speakers working in tandem. BUT ONLY while using the FireTV device. It does not work if I am using the smart TV streaming apps from the Vizio home screen. Which I don't do anymore except for a couple things that are not found on the Amazon App store.FYI, I don't believe that the Fire Edition Insignia and Toshiba televisions sold here and at Best Buy  have the capability to set up the Home Theater function with the Alexa app.Finally, a speaker group is the best way to get unlike models to sync with each other to play music. However, there's a catch... You must ask for that group's every time at the end of your request to play music etc.Meaning, with the stereo pair and home theater, music and movies are automatically played through those selected speakers by means of the Alexa app. You would simply make the standard request for Alexa to play a song or album with no extra added specification. But remember, you're limited to only pairing the same models together for this to work like that.Now, with a speaker group, you can include your Echoes, Dots, Shows, Spots, Inputs, FireTVs, Tablets etc etc into that group and have them all going at the same time through out your home, so long as you name this all-Echo inclusive group something like ""Every where"" or ""all speakers"" or ""whole house"". Be creative :) ""Echo Symphonic Orchestra"", ""Live from the Love Shack"", or ""on all decks of the Enterprise"" (you can even call your individual room groupings for lights and sounds things like "" the Bridge"" -Living Room, ""Ship's Galley"" -Kitchen, ""Ten Forward"" - dining or rec room, ""Shuttle Bay Two""-garage, "" Engineering""-utility room/basement, and ""Captain's Quarters""-master bedroom, ""Risa"" -backyard patio). Lol. Alexa groups can be named whatever you want! I digress though....The point is you have to tell Alexa to play music AND include the name of the speaker group everytime or else music will just play from the device you speak into. Ex: ""Alexa play the song Starships on all decks of the Enterprise"" or (boring) ""Alexa, play Mr. Robot-o, everywhere"" or ""Play a lullaby in the dirty diaper factory (nursry)"". Get it?! I can sense your mind is starting to ignite like a solid rocket booster, now.I really hope this helps someone. I know it's been a learning curve for me. And not always a lot of fun. Just wait til you first start exploring how to build your own custom routines or then decide to relocate devices into different rooms as you upgrade with new ones. It can be a labor of love...or regret.Bottom line, if you  are looking to upgrade but aren't entirely sure, try out the new Echo 4th Gen (especially in a pair for a Home Theater) and decide within 30 days if you really like them. Definitely explore the Alexa app and routines. And commit to replacing at least one bulb in each room with a color changing LED smart bulb to experience the fun you can have with this device. Also, I think you will be pleasantly surprised at what many people say is a drawback about being a directional speaker is really a benefit for most user's needs, including yours.Some people will find fault in anything and some will find that they can't have everything to their exact liking. There's not a perfect smart speaker out there, so figure out what you must have features are, your nice to haves, and your deal breakers are and make the choice.Regardless, enjoy these little glimpses of the future. Heck, they're even spherical shaped just like what the future devices and ships looked like in 2001: A Space Odyssey and Space Balls or a Borg scout ship, even. You gotta think that's at least a nice nod for sci-fi fans everywhere. Or if you are a devotee of mod design or simply a believer in form following function, then this ball of joy is sure to please. So, enjoy your new Echo; It's outta this world!-Picard, out. Hailing frequencies closed.\n",545 people found this helpful,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo
Echo_4th_Gen_With_premium_sound_smart_home_hub_and_Alexa,61.76,,,Arthur,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on March 17, 2023","Easy setup, great for what it is.","\nWell, I have to say I love that its a speaker that has Alexa on it. If I had to complain though it would be easy truthfully. The music function. I had the advertised Unlimited plus music feature, after it was advertised as the only way for my grandmother to play certain old songs she was looking for with ease instead of her asking and then getting a different song with an advertisement worked in. However, it worked out for 2 seconds because I thought, why not pay more and get an Amazon Echo dot too for her room ao she could listen through the house. So that apparently added almost 20 bucks a month to a free service we had before. Mind you, I already pay for Prime and I added the Music Unlimited. But because she wanted to play her music softly in her room for ambience and then play it differently in the livingroom, Amazon said she had to upgrade to another more expensive music package called Unlimited Family. Thats the only way to she can listen to music she wants on her devices throughout her home. Again, the service costs more than most video services and is more than spotify, xm radio, or well just about any radio service that allows the option to pick a song via voice recognition these days. They really like to nickel and dime you for the most basic things and it isnt riggt in my opinion. If you pay to have music options through Amazons library, why should you pay more and more for ease of getting to that music? I mean, Amazon music uses to have all the music I could ever look for free with my Amazon Prime membership. And I think they added the voice search feature before this fee on top of a fee thing happened. It is crazy to me that every time you want to actually use the products that come out to the desirable extent they are advertised, you get either microtransactions blown at you, or even worse now you get a hefty monthly additional bill. Again, after being a member with the company paying a monthly fee for over a decade. Why would they think this would keep customer loyalty? All it does is make customers hope for and await another option that has something similar or even a little less nice for a better price. Can you imagine if a competitor like Ebay or Facebook got together and created a decent music library access via buying something like soundcloud or spotify. It has to be easy for the CEOs to themeselves want another option on a platform built similar to the Echo. And people themselves in the public that for the middle class have to like me be eager to seek out that second option. Yes the supply chain and easy shipping options makes it the onlyntrue source to buy things quickly and easily and Prime is still a great deal for that reason. But the echo, the dot, etc... are all just waiting to be taken off the shelves at this rate. And it is awful, because the advertised version and or even the versions where you can use the full functionality after burning a million dollars on unlocking them each month proves the Echo and its component products can do and be great products that make amazon something worth keeping a membership with for years to come. However, selling a product to active prime members and then putting limiters all over the software with the intent to create more monthly revenue on a loyal cusyomer base that you could of just succeeded in making that much more reliant on keeping a membership. Thats jist greedy and dumb at the same time. The echo or other products of this line have zero need to have these extra upcharges is the point. Get rid of them before your customers get rid of the products tge moment a better option becomes viable. Yes we will keep prime for the shipping. But heck, prime video is just rediculous right now with advertisements, fees for decent shows and movies and then just nothing of real value for prime members. It used to be a great service with limited options. But we loved and used it all the same because it was free for Prime members. Same with Amazon music. I loved it and used it all the time. No its advertisements for every song or monthly fees. So tired of the fee onslaught that comes with buying anything that looks like its useful these days. Thats the summary here. Amazon, you dont need to do what your doing. Your products have the ability to be in every household and used regularly everywhere. You will make a killing just selling the next updated color of the echo. Imstead of closing up video and music access. Eat the costs on rights and give it to your prime customers. You already raised rates for that too. But your cutting services on top of raising rates. What are you thinking. Your monopoly isnt unbeatable. Its difficult to see past the day people choose something better knowing what your chains look like right now. But Im telling you, this way of pushing customers for everything you want just because you can at the moment will end up making you the myspace of well....you know. Thats just my and millions of other peoples opinion though right now. So take it for what its worth.\n",11 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo
Echo_4th_Gen_With_premium_sound_smart_home_hub_and_Alexa,61.76,,,C,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on December 15, 2020","New Shape, New Processor, Better Sound","\nThe new Echo 4th Gen is a big change in aesthetics and design for the Echo line.  The new spherical shape is wider and shorter than previous Echo versions, and now focus sound in one primary direction instead of 360 degrees.  It adds an extra tweeter, and seems to produce more sound than previous versions.  Here are my early thoughts so far, after using it for about 24 hours:THE GOOD:Setup was incredibly simple.  I just powered the device on, and the Echo announced that it was ready for setup.  I opened the Alexa app on my phone, and the new Echo was automatically detected and set up instantly.  I didn't have to enter any information at all.  It can't get any easier than this.BETTER SOUND.  This new Echo has an extra tweeter, for a total of two 0.8 inch tweeters, and the same 3.0 inch Sub from the Gen 3 Echo.  This new Echo is designed with the tweeters pointed forward, and the speaker placement seems to generate more bass also somehow, even with the same Sub as the Gen 3.  All in all I think it sounds much better than Gen 3, with a little more bass and louder max volume.  This could also be do to the sound-mapping feature that allows Echo to maximize the sound by detecting the acoustics and shape of the room.  You can also pair two of these in stereo; and you are supposed to be able to use it as a speaker for your FireTV device, though I haven't tested that out yet.Temperature sensor included.  Yes, you can ask Alexa what the temperature is, and it seems very accurate so far.  This is a nice touch, and I look forward to doing more testing, to see if I can set up routines based on temperature.AZ1 Processor. This new Amazon processor promises better voice recognition and faster Alexa responses.  In my testing so far, I have barely noticed a slight speed improvement (for example turning on certain room lights) but there are supposed to be upcoming updates that will make an even bigger difference in speed.Zigbee + Sidewalk Bridge.  This comes with a Zigbee hub, just like previous versions of the Echo Plus.  It also contains the new Sidewalk Bridge, which allows the Echo to use bluetooth and radio connections to connect to some smart devices at long range, and push data to the internet.THE BAD:No 360 degree speakers.  While I personally prefer the sound of this new version, some people might miss the 360 degree speaker setup of previous Echo generations.  It certainly might lead to a situation where the ideal placement of the Echo in your room could be different.White power cord.  This is minor, but a strange choice.  No matter what color Echo you get, the power cord is white.  Some people might find that annoying.Voice detection is not great while loud music is playing.  This surprised me, as previous generations haven;t really struggled with this in my experience.  I'm not sure if it is because this speaker is much louder, but Alexa hasn't heard me a few times when I talked while the music was playing at max volume.  This could be annoying if you often listen to very loud music.NEUTRAL: -Aesthetics.  I think I preferred the look of the cylinder design, instead of this new sphere shape.  This is totally personal preference of course.  I also wish the entire sphere was fabric, instead of being plastic on the back side.  Some people might prefer the ball shape though, so that is up to you.All in all, I'm keeping this new Echo because of the better sound and faster responsiveness, but it is not really a massive upgrade.  Pretty decent so far, I'll update this review and try to answer any questions in the future!\n","2,586 people found this helpful",Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo
Echo_4th_Gen_With_premium_sound_smart_home_hub_and_Alexa,61.76,,,Jeff S,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on November 22, 2022",These are like echo dots on steroids!! Twice as big but sound 5 times Better!!!,"\nI have my apartment which is not a small apartment and it has a loft as well for my 12-year-old son so he has his own area he\u2019s getting to that age so anyway I had I think 5 echo dots and one echo show that had the visual screen for pictures and things like that but without a subwoofer or anything I was fine with the multi room music and I used it for that and basically also used it so I could just tell any of my echo dots or just basically when I open the door I would say Alexa Turn on my apartment!! Immediately all of my lights would come on and some of them are dimmed to a certain level which you can do in the settings on your Alexa app that most people have on their phones. I even have a couple lightbulbs that are multicolored so I have them set to green and red currently for Christmas!! So the lights all come on when I tell Alexa to do that including my living room TV as well. You can add numerous other items that are compatible with Alexa and/or SmartThings app and you name it. If you don\u2019t have something that is compatible or doesn\u2019t have Bluetooth or wifi etc\u2026 as long as you use a plugin for that item you can at MINIMUM turn it off and on with your voice or touch screen on your phone or Alexa show and I bought 2 of these Echoes because my friends have one or more and it is a sphere. So even though it\u2019s twice as big as the echo dot, in the newer generations at least, they started out looking like a hockey puck which is still good and people have them still but I started using Alexa products just a couple years ago so, mine are all round balls that you can talk to and play music and control lights and cameras for security while home or check on your home while you\u2019re not there!!I bought 2 regular Echoes to replace 2 of the echo dots because they have 3 or 4 different speakers in each one!!! Crazy how much sound you get from the dot but the bigger one the regular echo, sounds like a huge floor speaker but it\u2019s just a ball and you can get black or white or blue and more so I got 2 of them to pair together for stereo sound and to my Samsung TV that has an Alexa app built into it. So I can rock out or get surround sound when paired with my TV and Soundbar Sub woofer which I don\u2019t use the soundbar anymore the echoes sounded better but I got them last month. They were 49.99 a piece!!! That\u2019s like half price and why I hadn\u2019t bought them before so for 100 bucks I have a completely wonderful set of speakers that you barely notice and they sound wonderful and you can buy them with a Studio speaker by Amazon or an Amazon Subwoofer bundled for even more awesome sound but I live in an apartment so I don\u2019t want to get kicked out!!! They act as a hub for all of your Amazon devices also so you don\u2019t need anything else but one echo honestly to run all of your lights just get the type of bulbs they suggest and they have bundles for those also and it\u2019s truly amazing what quality of sound and other things that they can do but I have already typed far toooooo much. Start with 1 even for listening to music over the holidays and add devices as you go. That\u2019s what I did and 2 years later I have it set up so we\u2019ll that I can talk to my son when he\u2019s at his Moms house on his echo and my echo here and there\u2019s no need for buying him a cellphone!! Yet!!There\u2019s just so much I could say about what these things do for 50 bucks to get one of them is a steal because you\u2019re just keep adding things and finding different things like grocery list reminders and alarms. It helps you with many things you wouldn\u2019t even imagine.So now, when I open my door to my apartment, I have it set to where the lights automatically come on with my TV. I don\u2019t even have to talk. It\u2019ll do that too so kudos to the designers of these things because they are very affordable and do so much.!!!\n",60 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo
Echo_4th_Gen_With_premium_sound_smart_home_hub_and_Alexa,61.76,,,Albert A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on March 17, 2023","Alex, turn up the music!","\nThe Amazon Echo (4th Generation) speaker has a sleek spherical design that is available in three colors: charcoal, glacier white, and twilight blue. It offers great audio quality for its price compared to premium speakers from other known brand, with one 3-inch woofer and two 0.8-inch tweeters that deliver strong bass and clear highs. The Echo has great smart home skills that can take control of compatible devices without the need of a separate hub. One of the neat features of this speaker is that it includes support for Amazon Sidewalk which can extend the range of your smart devices. The Echo also has and 3.5mm audio input/output that can be connected to external speakers or headphones as well as receive audio from other devices. Aside from controlling your devices, the Echo includes Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice assistant that can answer questions, play music, set timers, control smart devices, and so much more.When it comes to my experience with the Echo, I can\u2019t praise it enough. The initial setup is a breeze. There is only a power cable to plug into the device and to an electrical outlet. The Amazon Alexa app does a great job in walking you through the steps to get you up and running. For the most part, the speaker works great. In some occasions, the speaker doesn\u2019t wake up properly when using the wake word, in my case \u201cAlexa.\u201d I\u2019ve noticed that after several days I would have to unplug the device to force reboot it whenever it would happen. However, when Alexa does wake, she can sometimes have trouble hearing me even though she's placed well in the center of my bedroom. When it comes to audio quality, I\u2019m very impressed. The Echo easily became the go to speaker to listen to when I listen to music at home. For the current price, it\u2019s a great purchase and easy recommendation and even better when it gets marked down on sale. Can\u2019t wait to see what the 5th Gen brings to the table.\n",2 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

And I didn't think I was going to wind up using it very much but being visually impaired I wound up using it a lot more than I expected.I came to find out that I could listen to my audible books and also my kindle books read to me which is great for my visual impairment it makes it a lot more enjoyable during the day when I become bored with trying to figure out what is actually on the television with my provision some things are just not watchable like they used to be.But the echo. 2nd Gen. Speakers are well they leave a lot to be desired and I had to add additional speakers so when I saw this item I was like I'm gonna go see what the reviews are like and everyone said they were awesome they're awesome and so much better than the. 2nd Gen. So I decided to go ahead and get one for my birthday as a gift to myself and additionally I got the battery and the silicone carry case combination to go with it and I can take the thing all over my house in my yard and that is so cool.Since I've gotten this particular one though I have found there are so many other things that I can do with it other than just listen to my audio books and kindle books I can listen to podcasts I can get the daily news I can check the temperature in the room that the echo is in it is in which is really cool because I don't have an interior thermostat in my house I run on a space here and a wood stove so I never know what the interior temperature of my house is but I do now.There are also cool games you can play play I've been playing prices right and Trivia and a choose your own adventure kind of game andAre you smarter than a 5th grader by the way I'm smarter than a 5th grader.I opted in for Amazon music and not only am I finding all the songs that I've forgotten from my past but I found some really cool new ones things things that I would have never found without this echo.I've created playlists that when I'm in the mood for one thing or another I just tell she who cannot be named what playlist I want to hear and all of a sudden there I am.She can also actuate my televisionI have a roku TV but I have also added a fireStick as well and she can actuate both of them and also my easy buzz camera that I have to keep an eye on my front porch and yard and be able to speak to people out there when I have guests without going to the door.Being visually impaired this thing is a real helping hand the only thing would be better is if she could clean my house maybe Amazon will get there eventually.But for now I'm very fond of this deviceOther cool additional thingsI like how much bass the speaker has I like to listen to binaural beats music and meditation music and some dance music for exercise and I can feel the music it's pretty cool.The speaker is pretty darn decent.I chose the white version because because white is a color that I can see better with my vision the only concern I have is that the speaker cover might eventually get dirty but they get dirty I try to dust it on a daily basis just to make sure.We also are using it for well-to-do list for one, alarms, oh and I've set a household network up where the smaller echo. that I was gifted is now in my kitchen and I can play them as a group oop or someone in my kitchen can drop in on me and ask me if I want dinner or if I'm busy and vice versa I can drop in on them as well well additionally I've set it up so I can tell it to make phone calls directly from my cell phone and works as a great speaker phone I've tested it out a few times and everybody says that they can hear me just fine and clear.By the way for a little fun ask her to Beam me up Scottie.

Echo_4th_Gen_With_premium_sound_smart_home_hub_and_Alexa,61.76,,,Don B,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on January 7, 2023",DON'T buy a used one!,"\nI bought 2 of these as refurbished, to add to the other 3 that I have in the downstairs of my home. One would not connect after repeated attempts.  Not the end of the world, just inconvenient and a hassle. Especially after working all day, this should be about a 15 minute procedure for BOTH units. So, after 45 minutes on ONE, I stopped attempting the connection, and switched to the other unit.  The other unit connects within minutes (as it should) and I went back to the other one. This is the 5th time now to attempt a connection, and it won't take. So, I click on the Alexa app for an Amazon rep with technical support to call me. So, a guy calls, and wants me to walk through the connection process with him on the phone. I get it, they need to verify the issue, so I oblige him and go through it with him on the line.Well, attempt number 6 fails with him on the phone, and let him know that was as far as I could get prior to asking for tech support. He wants me to unplug it, and start it back up again. I said OK, but this will be the 6th time of doing that exact thing. So I unplug it, and it reboots itself (as before), and we walk through the setup process again, and guess what?  Will NOT connect. I asked since this was refurbished, if it was possible, by any chance, that it is still connected to the previous owner?  He said he already checked on that, and it was not. So, now he wants me to unplug it once again, and close the Alexa app. I did both already, and informed him of such, but he insists that we need to do so.  OK, we'll try it again. So unplug, close the app completely, plug back back in, power up, and reopen app. Go through set up process, will not connect again.  Frustration is starting to creep up on me, and he says hang on, I am going to reset your system remotely.  Ok, maybe that helps (perhaps he should have suggested that early on?), I don't know. Either way, phone is silent for a minute or so, then the hold music starts to play for another minute or 2 (maybe 3, not even sure now) and then I am disconnected!  Wow, really? Ok, I am sure that was an error on his part, not intentional, but still....So, I call back, get bounced to the right department, tell the story to another tech support guy, he agrees that it is faulty and says he can just refund my purchase. Well, I let him know that I don't want a refund, I want a replacement item. That is why I bought 2 more to begin with.  No luck, refund only, so I agree to it.Well the other that is connected up, once I played some music on it, the speaker was obviously worn out, and distorted.So now, I am returning both of them.Probably going to go with 2 new ones at this point.\n",10 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I\u2019m living in the future and that Future is here NOW!,"\nI have 8 Echos in various rooms and from several generations. Yep, I have a big house... What attracted me to this generation was that onboard voice capabilities that makes response faster and sure, who doesn\u2019t want even better sound quality? I also liked the design better than the looks of the previous generations and that I could see the activity \u2018light ring\u2019 when I was sitting down. The spherical designed has some real advantages and it\u2019s apparent in the improved sound. And improved it is. Music is easily better, more complex and effortless. This is NOT supposed to be a blast the neighborhood out speaker, but it did fill a larger room with quality sounding music that is noticeably improved to past generations. Voice commands and responses are practically instant and tigger happy quickly improved... Me likes so much that I replaced 2 of my 8 for in the areas where I am most using them. I even returned my first gen to amazon to get 25$ off then new one. Understand, my old ones are in pristine condition with all the original packaging and boxes, but how great to be able to do this!My whole house is voice controlled, lighting, fireplaces (ceramic logs with LED \u2018fake fire lights\u2019), thermostat and as an early adopter of the Echo Voice Assistant, I\u2019ve never looked back. Being able to ask any question, to ask about a stores hours before even driving there to make sure it\u2019s open and then being given the option to phone DIRECTLY from the device, is sweet. And how about NEVER having to touch your alarm clock to hit snooze or turn it off again? Yes please. Get quick and accurate local weather reports instantly, air quality too! Need to be reminded, multiple timers or announcements and intercom functions. Just say the word. I have every news channel I want set in my flash briefing and LOVE these, hearing them most days. Here\u2019s my line up:  Daily scripture, this day in history, Fox news, BBC news, Management tip of the day and a few more. You can easily add what YOU want to hear and it\u2019s a treat. I LOVE podcasts and there\u2019s a series called \u201cHardcore History\u201d with hundred of episodes. Some of which are 6 hours long! What\u2019s cool is I can start one of these while I\u2019m cooking in the kitchen, tell the device to stop when I\u2019m finished and when I later (day, month, weeks or whatever) tell it to \u201cPlay Hardcore History\u201d it will name the episode I left off on and pick it up for exactly the same spot! How sweet that??And guys, knock yourselves out because there are thousands of podcasts on virtually any subjects to enjoy and learn from. I love having this ability!!! LOVE, Love, love the ability to always be learning new things from this device while still doing what I do do in the background. There\u2019s so much more and I could literally go on for hours with what a great enhancement this has been in so many ways, learning, security, information, entertainment, news, communications, etc. Being able to have my arms full, walk though my house and just TEll a light to turn on along the way without having to touch or find a switch is sublime!  Yep, you need the right lights, but boy, talk about convenience and living in the future now. NEVER going back!  Even my landscaping lights and sprinkler control system, my security cameras works with it. And if I want to make an announcement to the whole house, I just say, \u201cEcho, repeat EVERYWHERE\u201d and then tell it what I want to say. And all 8, in every room will go off: \u201cDinner is in 5 minutes!\u201d So sweet!I also have 2 of the Echo Clocks that work with the device and they are awesome. The LED ring and countdown before the alarm going off is sweet.But guys, I even LOVE just telling the Echo to play rain/storm sound effects and it\u2019s calming, deep and healing. What a wonderful, effortless device with so many capabilities. Even during one of my personal bible studies, I can ask Echo for some background on virtually anyone I reading about and background is forthcoming.Yes, I was an early adopter and man, these are a purchase I\u2019ve never regretted making. I use them EVERY day and they have enhanced my life in ways that are special, rich and convenient. Like something out of a Dick Tracy comic from the 1930\u2019s, this system is here, ripe, mature and developed. I\u2019m such a fan!The only suggestion I have for Amazon would be to give me the option in a metal package. Who wants to dust fabric? Lastly, IF you built in even great Biblical knowledge capability, you\u2019d sell even millions more. Give me a teaching assistant that has a data base to field just about anything biblical I could ask of it.LOVING this product and the direction it\u2019s going. The future IS now and ECHO is the best, most supported, device with thousands and thousands of functions. Thank you Amazon and keep enhancing this baby because I\u2019m upgrading all along the way.

The echo 4th gen is definitely the best of all of these. I have even owned the bose portable, some really expensive Sony speakers. For the size and sound quality and reliable and fast voice recognition, these can't be beat.Issues with the homepods:The homepod had great sound quality, but it was big and you still dont get the stereo separation effect you can get with two speakers one on each side of the room, and after a firmware update the speaker developed a weird and terrible sounding issue and I had to throw it away. Apple discontinued it so I couldn't buy a replacement. The homepod minis used to be good, in fact better sound quality than probably the echo dot 5th gen (I didn't test it personally, just heard the sound in a review). However they started becoming unreliable as well, one would cut out midsong or there would be a weird echoing effect and the voice recognition was always slower than an echo device. And sometimes siri wouldn't recognize at all, or she would say 'something went wrong, this is taking longer than I expected'.... a lot.So switching over to two Echo 4th gens, in a stereo pair, was really great because the voice recognition is faster and she usually understands what I say and play it. I could say the same request to both and Siri wouldn't get it while Alexa would.However there was a major issue, at first they wouldn't pair in a sound pair. I had to web search and find out that what you have to do is plug in one speaker only, say 'alexa check for updates' and then wait until that speaker updates, then unplug it, do that for the second speaker, unplug it when done, then update the alexa app on your phone, then plug everything back in and try to pair them again in the app. That worked for me. Amazon really dropped the ball on this, and I had to remove a star, you shouldn't get a product that has a basic feature like the speakers working in a stereo pair that requires a bunch of googling to solve. I can imagine the frustration if you buy two and then they don't work in a stereo pair and your googling skills aren't good enough. Another knock on Alexa compared to Siri in general, is that lately Alexa has been spamming me asking me if I want stuff. Siri never does that. Alexa will say things like 'by the way (advertisement, would you like to try it/buy it?) However as far as I know there is no reliable Apple smart speaker that exists so this is your best option. Note that I didnt try the google products because I gave up on google made products, they all seem to break (chromebook, pixel 6, google wifi, etc. and then google always makes some excuse why they wont fix it- so not only do their products break but they also won't fix them- I gave up on them)\n",6 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

While this device is an excellent addition to any home, one downside is that it has a limit on the number of speakers that can be added to create a home theater setup.Unfortunately, the Alexa app only allows you to add up to two speakers to your home theater system when using the Echo (4th Gen) as the hub. This limitation can be frustrating for those who want to create a more immersive audio experience, as it prevents them from adding additional speakers to enhance the sound quality of their home theater setup.It's important to note that this limitation is not unique to the Echo (4th Gen) and is a limitation of the Alexa app in general. However, it's still disappointing for those who were hoping to create a more robust home theater setup with the Echo (4th Gen) as the hub.Despite this limitation, the Echo (4th Gen) is still a great device that offers excellent sound quality and a variety of useful features. Its smart home hub capabilities make it easy to control various devices in your home, and its built-in Alexa functionality provides a hands-free way to access music, news, and other features.Overall, while the limitation on the number of speakers that can be added to a home theater setup may be a drawback for some, the Echo (4th Gen) remains a powerful and useful device that offers a lot of value for its price\n",4 people found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

My first impressions are that the sound quality (for the price and size of the device) is excellent.  There is copious quantities of base.  The highs are also quite good provided you place the speaker out in the open and are facing the front side of the device.  The voice recognition is almost flawless if  the room is quiet.  However I found that Alex has some issues hearing me correctly whenever I was playing music, listening to the TV, or when my Roomba was banging around the house.  I think it's reasonable that situations like this can cause Alexa to either not hear you, or misinterpret what you said.... and I can accept that.My Echo's are connected to my 5GHz wifi network and are located all within 30 ft of my router.  I've never had any issues with the wifi connection.  A couple of times in the past 3 months the Alexa service has gone down, which can be a real issue.  Luckily, ""most"" of my smart devices (Kasa and Feit) could all be controlled through their native apps.  Fortunately for me, Alexa was only down for a couple of hours, and then all was good.  The bad part was that my mother-in-law, who is in a wheelchair, uses Alexa to control the lights, ceiling fan, and TV in her apartment.  The lesson here is that if you have a technically challenged person who relies of Alex, just realize that there will be times when Alex lets you down... and you'll need to have a backup plan to get buy until the service comes back online.Regarding integration with other manufacturer's devices is hit and miss, depending on how main stream (widely used) their products are.  I had no issues getting 5 Kasa smart plugs (for air cleaners and dehumidifier), 4 Kasa smart dimmers (for lights), 3 Kasa smart switches (for ceiling fans), and about 20 Feit smart bulbs, all connected and integrated into Alexa.  Personally, before choosing a brand of smart product, go onto the Android/Apple app store (as appropriate for you), and check out the ""Start"" rating for that manufacturer's app.  If it has a poor rating, it might be a good idea to choose a different manufacturer.  The 4th generation Echo has a built in temperature sensor, which lets you create ""routines"" that can be triggered by the room temperature.  The Echo can also listen for sounds like ""glass breaking"", and ""smoke/CO alarms"".  If the Echo hears these sounds, you can get a notification on the phone app.  Awesome feature, and it's free.  There are more advanced security/safety features, but those have a monthly fee.It's hard to review just the Echo, when in fact it's impossible to separate it from the Alex service. As a piece of ""hardware"", what you get in such a small package is impressive (5 stars).  The other half of the rating is how well Alex integrates with your smart devices, and how well you use the capabilities within the Alex app to configure your Echo device.  One of the most important functions is the ability to create ""routines"".  A routine is a set of commands that get performed, when the trigger phrase is spoken.I'll say that the capabilities available with routines is mind blowing.

Getting each one setup on their own was simple and quick. Making sure to change the activation name to not grab both of them at the same time for simple commands and questions.I had a heck of a time getting them to go into the home theater group only to find out that they needed updates and then everything went smoothly. This is a must. Once on and running ask them if they have any updates and then they will finish.Occasionally when switching apps back and forth the sound forgets where it was and a simple volume down and back up seems to fix that. Though I wish the remote would allow for solid hold vs. clicking every notch up or down.Something that I took for granted was the fact that if your internet decides to have issues your speakers also will. Our previous setup was an old pioneer wired unit and didn't care about internet. These do. Not a deal breaker but worth noting.Sound is pretty decent. Is it a 5k dollar sound system absolutely not. Does it fill a room to the point of neighbors knowing what you are watching I would say yes. Sound is clear through all volume level, but the equalizer I think could use some updates for real adjustments.For a true surround sound setting, being able to pair more than 2 echos and a sub would be a great option.I would buy these again.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

If you're used to room enveloping sound with no sense of stereo this one will disappoint. Dual tweeters firing forward give it a true sense of direction so sticking it in a corner and have it fill the room will not be as satisfying.  You'll notice where it's located more, especially if there's anything blocking your direct line of sight ( hearing ) . Where I keep mine only needed a slight shift to make it not be partially blocked by my sofa . Volume was still plenty loud in its old spot but it just didn't sound right. Easily solved but might not be that easy for others and some might actually prefer the directional sound more.The bass can be a bit boomy though while listening to YYZ live in Rio the bass drum didn't sound bad at all and overall everything was satisfactory though slightly lacking in the mid highs.  The eq settings in the Alexa app are set to flat on all 3 choices .It's wider at the base than the previous generations by a lot. This could be a problem for some .Star Trek Self Destruct Skill  doesn't work on this one or my 4th gen Dot but does fine on my previous generation ones for some reason . Instead of blowing up my den it searches for ""zero zero zero"" movies on my Fire Stick. I'm sure that won't last long though .Enough about the bad.The bass is no longer wannabe but real. No longer does it struggle with everything below mid level voices but as I wrote above , bass drums actually sound like bass drums and Ends of the Earth by Lord Huron excels at all of the music ranges considering its size. Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams also sounded very nice across the sound spectrum . Music For Tables extreme from the high notes in the keyboard to the lows didn't miss a thing whereas the cow bell  was very slightly muddy but the wood blocks sounded right . Am I saying it's as awesome as my studio headphones ? Not by any means but they took a huge step forward over the 3rd generation , which I was quite content with .Response time seems noticeably faster and more accurate than the gen 3 I use . Only once did Alexa not understand my query and that was while setting up a traffic check routine. All I had to do was rephrase a little and now Alexa tells me the commute traffic and fastest way to get to work 5 minutes before I have to leave . 95 is terrible for accidents and Maps tells Alexa the best alternative if there's any.I think my favorite thing though is the new shape and I REALLY like the lights being on the bottom, especially once the lights go off .If you're still smitten with your gen 3 Echo or don't like the mini Death Star look of the new model skip this one as the performance improvements are readily apparent they're not earth shattering.  Amazon will have to do something mind blowing next year to get me to part with my dough ray me for a gen 5. The more I listen to Fourplay on Echo the more I'm liking it for the music , nevermind all the super cool stuff I can do on it or my Dots or my Flex .\n",2 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

If the volume is turned up during music play you will have to scream through the music for the unit to be able to hear your next request.  The sound during music playback is impressive but not always. I'd give it 90%. Integration with other Alexa-supported devices and services is superior. The words are super clear and the music is well-integrated. Except to first link it to your wi-fi and perhaps Bluetooth there's no need to touch the unit. Everything is controlled by speaking and every unit is connected. Set a reminder with one and with the Alexa App logged in your reminder pops up on your phone as well. Bear in mind the reminder only populates on the individual unit you requested it from. However, delivery notifications populate on every device.

While I was doing some research, I saw a huge sale on the Echo for $59. For the price of a budget soundbar system, I was able to buy two echos and an Echo Sub.The software is wonky and frustrating to use sometimes. It took a half hour for the it to recognize the Echos as a stereo pair. Once they did, I was able to set them up in seconds. After that, I set it up with the Fire Stick as a home theater. The Echo sub hadn't even arrived yet. The sound is actually pretty amazing. The speakers sound crystal clear and provide competent bass. Music listening is where these speakers REALLY shine. There is a huge difference when you listen to music in true stereo.Going back to the software, That's why it's 4 stars instead of 5. I woke up the next morning, and the home theater no longer had sound. I deleted the group and set it up again, no luck. I noodled with the software for 2 hours, and it just refused to work. This seems to be a known issue. After getting the boxes together to return the devices, 6 hours later, the software magically fixes itself. Just to be certain, I spent some time trying to break it again to see where the instability is, but it's rock solid now. I'm thinking they pushed it into production without properly testing the software. Once it broke, they must have pushed a big update to fix it. It just took time for the updates to happen on all the devices. You hear that Amazon? You need to do a better job of testing your software!That being the case, it's the smartest home cinema you can buy. Most soundbar systems will make you use a separate remote to switch channels to Bluetooth, if you want Alexa to work...unless you want to pay for Alexa integration. The dual Echo configuration is completely seamless, because...well, it's an Echo. Music is what it does best. If you want music, Alexa plays music in full stereo. If you want to watch a movie, it automatically plays the sound in Dolby Digital using the Fire Stick. My Echo Sub arrived today, and I'm REALLY looking forward to trying that out.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

However it's dependent on speaker placement. I had the sub quit on me so I bought a new echo sub with 2 new echoes. Even after tweaking it's not as good as it was walking around the room. It's great near the speaker. Biggest negative is the WiFi connection. It only works on non WiFi 6e 5ghz channel which is basically the guest network 5ghz. I tried disabling the other radio to just have 5ghz and it doesn't work. Check the forums and it works on the guest network. Until Alexa realizes it's on the guest network then it switches to the 2.4ghz regular network channel. I'm not happy about that at all because I have quite a few things already attached to the 2.4 hubs for cameras and lights, ceiling fans thermostat vacuum plugs etc. Live and learn overall great speaker just don't expect more out of it over the 3rd gen. maybe the next generation will be 6e compatible and actually have better sound without worrying where to place them\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

Since I am disabled and at times am bed ridden I converted my home to a smart home with the use of Alexa and Alexa enabled devices. I added so many that I noticed I started having some problems so I got this (4th gen with hub). So far so good. She can hear me clearly. She even understands me when I am in pain (which admittedly is hard to do!).She controls my roku, firestick, multiple tv's, garage door, lights, xmas tree, ceiling fans and robot vac. She reminds me to take my medicine or doctors appts.The call for help function is great, if I fall down I tell her to call for help and she's calls the designated contact and text messages them simultaneously ""so and so has an emergency in the house"" ensuring if they are anywhere near their cell they will answer (HEADSUP- if setting that feature up I would warn them first or it might cause them to panic). I can make regular calls through it also after I set up my cell to work with it. (all of this works with the gen3 also).So helpful I ordered some for my mom as well. I love Alexa BUT I don't like the breach of privacy like it stores your network passwords on their servers, obviously listens when not supposed to, etc. That being said, for the reasons listed above its invaluable.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

The speaker itself is great, I just wish It was capable of playing my mp3's without a line in cord (sold separately). Yes, all music played must be streamed via wifi or you can connect another device to the Echo speaker (i.e. cell phone) via an old school line in cable. Alexa is cool, she lags to respond sometimes and she could really use some updated features, more user options and maybe bluetooth technology to play music without streaming or that darn cord.

But an issue arose when the small cable that connected the base battery to the Echo began to have intermittent connection issues. We'd have to wiggle the cable to make it work at times.When the new and improved Echo 4 came out we decided to try it. It was also $20 less than the original. We've had it about a month now and use it everyday outside for at least a few hours. We also bought a mobile battery base for it so we can play it outside without plugging it in. First impressions are there is a significant increase of base, treble, and overall fullness to the sound. The volume is crystal clear and there is no distortion when the volume is turned up, though we haven't turned it up full blast. We read some reviews stating the voice recognition was lacking but we haven't had any issues with it outside by the pool. The first day we had it we did a test to see how it would pick up our voices while in the pool. We moved about 6-8 feet away in the pool and it still clearly picks up our voices. The is also a little added noise from the pool fountain which is also on the other side of the pool but doesn't seem to affect the Echo. The base has four blue dots that are lit indicating power levels. For us it is playing for about 4 hours total with the volume at halfway to three quarters. The old Echo and base played up to 6 hours or longer but the new Echo 4 has a second tweeter and larger woofer to power, which is why it sounds so much better. No complaints here. We have a Jackery 300 watt hour mobile power generator to plug it into if we're outside all day. When done we bring it in, plug it in, and within about 3 to 4 hours the power base is fully charged again.Of course if you just play it inside all day you can leave it plugged in and there is no need for the battery base.Another plus ... The old Echo simply sat in the battery base housing and the two were connected with the small cable I mentioned that began to fail. The new Echo base has a large screw ton the bottom that secures it tightly to the Echo. You simply match up the contacts on the base and Echo, then tighten the screw that keeps them tightly secured to each other. This has eliminated the audio cable so the two can stay connected all the time. The new battery base is also much wider so there is little chance of it tipping over.Final impressions ... a clear improvement over the original with better sound, a wider base, and eliminated that cable that would eventually fail. Oh, and it cost less than the original. :)\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

I started with the Ring security system to replace my 12 year old Frontpoint. One Dot led to another. Now Echo, the hub, is there looking at me.I guess the speaker is OK. I am not a good sound critic. One thing is I can hear the words in songs pretty clearly. It is loud. The bass made my little wood cabinet top rumble and vibrate. Two magazines under the speaker fixed that. The speaker can be very loud.Yes, voice recognition on this round Echo is not as good as the dots. It does not filter noise well. With TV on, people talking, fan blowing. playlist playing, Echo can't pick you out of the crowd. How could it ? It sometimes does not recognize questions correctly and gives off the mark answers. Often there is slow or no response. It called me my son's name and some random man's name today. It seems to process more slowly than the others. I think another reboot will help. My dot puck was awful until a few reboots.There is the puzzle. I like puzzles. Is it settings, hardware, software, interference, time of day, location? Can I try it on 5hz? So much is on 2.4...I always imagine things are harder than they are.Alexa is soooo much fun as well. This big speaker adds to it. We are thrilled and amazed with ordering lights on and off. The cavemen see a flashlight. I waited 20 years for linked wireless speakers. The one I tried years ago was not compatible with wifi.I have to keep an eye on the Alexa application. Settings seem to change randomly. I am sure I am doing it as I read and try things.Echo wouldn't talk chime wouldn't chime... and you also have to remember close the app, reboot tha tablet and start again.People seem to have affection for the can shaped Echos. They would have been knocked over at my house. This big round speaker takes up a lot of space but won't move. Maybe it is too big to wall mount. My home is small so it's a proportion thing. The cord would limit how high it could be mounted.About that white cord and my white echo. The echo is gray, not white. The cord is the exact same gray. The cord is too short. My 40 year old home does not have enough electrical outlets, so I need a longer cord for best placements. I didn't want to put it on a power strip.So I now have a hobby. It is a lot of fun.I will know how Echo works with my new Ring security system...if they ever send it.  My lost and then escalated, expedited order may come ....sometime, so they say.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

Why?  Because Alexa is much more versatile, efficient and ""ready"" than Siri. I've got  a Echo 4g in every room on every night stand.  I use her every day and night to play virtually any music that comes to mind from my enormous record collection 2000+ albums and from various radio stations (including one that's accessible only on the HD band).  I have one recommendation for music collectors: know the exact ALBUM TITLE of the artist  you wish to play.  Otherwise, Alexa will cut you off and recommend her own music.  (You can find this info on Wikipedia or at AllMusic.com or on a service like iTunes (or Amazon music or Spotify.)Most speaker reviews that I've been reading are worthless because they're from tech guys who don't know how to listen to symphonic literature or mainstream jazz with 4/4 walking acoustic bass.  The first thing that caught my attention about audio from this ""groovy globe"" (the Echo 4) was the true, clear, pitch-identifiable sounds of acoustic bass--on Duke and Basie from the '30s and '40s as well as Bill Evans trio from the '60s.The boosted boogie-hip-hop mayhem of pop music simply doesn't allow a speaker to show what it's made of.Hard to criticize fault this even for $100, though sonically it's not that much better sonically than my Echo 1st Gen, which originally came out at twice the price.  But unlike the first Gen, this 4th Generation Echo doesn't back down the least at those low notes and thickly textured passages.  The sound is tight with minimal ""breaking-up"" when rock guitar is in the mix. I plan to put it through my last tests: solo piano (I like to  hear a Steinway or Bosendorfer, not another monotonous RVG piano); solo voice (like many musicians, I tend to pass over vocalists in favor of pianists and tenor players, but I'm sure Frank and Sarah will receive full justice by this global design); finally, how well can it handle Stravinsky and Bartok.I understand it's a smart speaker, though I can't always make it play the tunes stored on my iPhone.  I'm sure it can.  In the middle of the night I'm too tired or impatient to give it actionable commands.  ""Hey, Alfred--or whatever your name is-- What time is it?  Where am I?  Never mind, just turn off the lights.""\n",One person found this helpful,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

A little better than the Show5, but not as good as a Dot 3rd Gen or the Plus 2nd Gen.  When I ask Alexa for something, I am sitting closest to this ball, but the Plus across the house hears me better and responds.I like that they have temperature sensors in them, and am Trying to find out if I can get a widget on my phone to list all the temps from my 5 devices that have sensors.  Haven\u2019t found a way to do that yet, but I do have a routing set up that announces the garage temp at 3:00 pm from my dining room Plus.I don\u2019t need the ultrasonic sensor that I know of, and don\u2019t use Zigbee for anything, so it would be better to make the device hear us better and leave those things out.I got a great deal on those Echo Plus 2nd generation devices. I bought 2, but had I known how superior those are, I\u2019d have gotten 6!  Limit was 3 per account!The light ring on the bottom of the ball is much less noticeable, and Less annoying as well. I hate those yellow rings for notifications.

I think the alexa devices may work best if you don\u2019t mix generations. Many people report newer generations not hearing them while the old models hear from across the house. I think the new ones hear you fine but the older models may take over responding before the newer ones have a chance. I have many theories on why that could happen - but anyway, if you have mixed generations and the new ones seem bad, try turning off the mics on the old ones and try again.On to the rest! So I bought 8 gen four echos on a sale and set them up in every room of my house. This was an upgrade from a 2nd gen echo dot and a few old speakers. To me, this was a massive massive upgrade. The sound quality is better than I expected. I\u2019m very impressed with the bass and the lack of distortion from these pomelo sized smart speakers - though to be fair I didn\u2019t have anything amazing before to compare them to. I do have very nice earbuds and the sound quality of these echos is good enough that I exclusively use them when I\u2019m at home now.Being able to have them play music everywhere at once and fill the house while I do chores is amazing. They can play perfectly in sync.I have philips hue bulbs in every room. I can walk into any room and say \u201calexa lights on\u201d or \u201calexa lights off\u201d and they almost always know which one I\u2019m talking to and respond with the lights that belong to that room\u2019s group. Of course this depends on your speaker placement and which way you\u2019re facing when you give the command.The full sized 4th gen echo also has a built in zigbee hub which I haven\u2019t tried yet, a temperature sensor which I use often, and motion detection ability which I didn\u2019t know it had until I after I got them.I heard max routines is 99 and I may be in danger of running into that limit. I have routines to alert me to unusually high and low temperatures, routines to control the lights, and routines to guard the house using motion detection.Overall extremely satisfied. However, I am an engineer and a software developer. Getting my system to work as well as it does may not be easy for everyone. If I got these as a gift for someone it would include having me set up everything they want so it just works.I\u2019m working on an easier way to control them for my most common commands than using my voice or using the app. Taking this a step closer to magic. ;)\n",22 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

We can use it as a Bluetooth speaker to play those other options, but it just doesn\u2019t work as well as casting from the phone/app.We used to have a lot of problems with Alexa understanding what we were saying and the commands we were giving. After 6-9 months we reset all of our echo products and things have definitely been better. Not perfect but better. My only other complaint is that I can\u2019t figure out the drop in feature.

The little hockey pucks.  Not used for music but for a virtual assistant, controlling smart lighting and also controlling my TV's Firestick that tunes over-the-air television through my Recast.  I loved it.  But then I got an Echo Show for the kitchen and I really enjoyed playing music on it while cooking.  The sound quality was ok.  Nothing to brag about.  Then I decided to upgrade my hockey pucks to the newer full size Echos.  I bought two Echos and placed one in the bedroom and one in the living room.  I would play music through them and the sound quality was very surprising.  So then I decided to get one more for the back porch.  That evolved into wanting another for the porch that I could pair to the other.That's when everything changed for me!  When you pair two of them together and set it up as a stereo pair; it is really amazing.  I sit outside now and I listen to music (in stereo!) on the porch.  The bass can be felt in my chair.  I'm so impressed.  I have 5 acres and with the volume turned up to 7, I can hear the music just about anywhere on my property.I plan on getting more Echos and enhancing the music when I listen to it inside the house.  I have the Bose 700 Soundbar and Subwoofer in my living room.  It sounds great for movies, TV and music.  But I prefer the Echos when listening to music.  Its perfect.  I can have Echos placed around the house and have music playing softly and you can hear it everywhere.I'm very impressed.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

We love them. So we decided to finally try the newest version in our kitchen. Overall, still great. But not as good as generation 3 units. First, don't worry about the directional speaker if you put these against a wall already. It still fills the room with sound. But here's what isn't as good: voice activation doesn't seem as tight as gen 3. I'm a composer and sound guy and while the low might be a bit better here over gen 3 but the rest of the sound just isn't as full as as the previous version. Gen3 is just a richer sound. Finally, and something I didn't see coming, the new shape. People can debate if they like it or not, but having it out for just a few days, and because the whole top is speaker mesh, you get finger prints from the buttons and dust and other air-gunk gets stuck on it and it can't be wiped away because, well, it's speaker mesh. This is going to be a big deal over time as this isn't going to look good in a year from now, where gen 3 could just be wiped off. I hope the next version abandons this current globe design, simply for this reason.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

Found that I listened to music as I worked around the house, but that the music sound quality wasn't as good as I wanted.Bought 3 Echo 4th Gen w/Premium Sound, two of them on Black Friday for ~$50 each.  Very pleased with them. If you use an Echo to interact with Alexa or to stream spoken word (e.g., podcasts, news, audio books), I'd say an Echo Dot is sufficient. If, however, you stream music, consider spending a bit more to get the Echo 4th Gen w/ Premium Sound. The Dot has 1 speaker; the Echo 4th Gen has 3 speakers (woofer + 2 tweeters). The sound is noticeably richer.  The bass is cleaner  -- no rattling, thumping I sometimes get with the Echo Dot.I kept the Dots in the speaker group, but used the app to reduce the bass so there is no rattling/thumping when playing songs with hefty bass.

I haven't gone into the hub or ultrasound abilities yet but the sleep sounds I listen too at night is far improved. I like the look too. I did blue to keep them figured out if I get more for another room later. So far the only irritating thing is I have to repeat myself for Alexa to start playing something but it did that with echo3.

Not worth listening to music on really. The echo show I find to be pretty useless. I bought it to use it in the kitchen to see recipes on all recipes and it worked at first and then all of a sudden it stopped working with all recipes. The screen is quite annoying on it. It got unplugged pretty early on and sat in my closet. This  gen 4 device I purchased for the sound since that\u2019s what\u2019s most important to me and operating lights and such.

However, experience with the product over time has taught me that it's well worth keeping around.  Think of this product like a template that you can just keep adding functionality to, and you will understand.I am writing this review after about 1-2 months of ownership and that is with only a cursory understanding of what's possible, since I don't normally use wifi  (I'm an ethernet guy).  For example, I bought Alexa in order to completely re-invent the lighting system in my room.  Welp, you're not gonna do any of that without wi-fi.  Even with that said, I spent more time on understanding hard wiring, re-wiring, and cable management than I have with any ""problems"" with Alexa.Once online, it enabled me to control anything independently that I've connected.  You just buy some smart power strips and you are good to go (after you connect the apps with your phone).  So yeah, everything is run on apps and wifi, but stuff like lights, on or off, color, dimness, effects, it's all changed with magic words now.  I type in ""desk backlight"", and if I say those words, Alexa remembers that these are the words I use when want to control that specific subset of lights.I can ask it to tell me about the wind gusts in Albany tomorrow for drone flying, I can ask it to lock my doors, listen for... noises in my bedroom from 100 miles away, or ask how many square feet my room is in inches, and I can ask it to talk like Snoop Dog (sorta, it's just a translator)Either way, it was fascinating to see how all the different apps for all the different hardware now just connect in a seamless way and then I don't need to think about anything... just speak and insult my device lol.Last but not least: Spotify.  From Spotify on your computer OR phone, Alexa can be used as the speaker.  For me, that is a convenience at the moment, when I have different home audio systems wired up but don't want to spend time switching cables.Conclusion: If you are into learning a few smart home basics, Alexa is worth a buy for many reasons and some I haven't even discovered yet.  And no, you do not have to use the word ""Alexa"" to issue commands, I have mine set to ""computer"".\n",5 people found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

Very happy with this unit. My main voice recognition complaint is she can't tell a squawking parrot from a dog, and when I am upstairs with the dog, resting silently, I'll get fone notices saying that the dog is barking, and would I like to drop in downstairs?  I've then asked her if she is guarding my house and she isn't. So no clue why I get constant notices! Now I won't believe her when she is guarding! I do like a new feature. With the loud parrots, I would call her name and she would flash her light, make an negative sound and stop responding. Yes, I have cussed at the AI when she didn't recognize my voice, and that is her default reaction to a cuss! But now, when I'm yelling across the room and the parrots then yell over me, instead if an AI version of a certain rude gesture, with light and sound and refusing to continue, she has learned manners. She politely says ""I'm sorry. I can't hear you. Could you repeat that?"". Much nicer. Again, the sound is way better than a single or pair of dots. More projection in  different directions. Works nicely with the music subscription.

We wanted to buy another HomePod to create a \u201csurround sound\u201d experience (they have since discontinued the large HomePods). So we decided to make the switch, when these work they work amazing, their sound and bass are not as good as our HomePod was but with 2 it made a richer experience. We have ran into some issues, a few resets and wifi troubleshooting later we are still having problems. Wifi is not an issue at my house, we have fiber and the speeds are amazing. For a while the echos would randomly just stop playing sound, whether that be music, from Netflix, YouTube, you name it. After many resets we have almost eliminated that issue, but one still remains, after streaming for a while the echos start making a weird staticky electronic noise (almost futuristic glitchy). We have to then turn off our fire stick and then when it turns back on it freezes for a few minutes, we go back to what we were watching and then 80% of the time the sound goes back to normal.

The built-in hub is nice if you need it.  It's footprint, especially in the orb like shape, is quite a bit larger.  I did order the wall mount for that reason & it does pickup voices better when elevated above the reverberation of all of the items at floor level.The ability to pickup voices is one of the two issues I encounter with Echo devices, elevating them does help.  The other is Amazon Music integration.  It was not great but seems to just get worse.  Feedback, questions, & troubleshooting all go down a dark path where one quickly sees there is no obvious light at the end.  The inability to easily integrate Youtube music addsto he frustation.  One of the two needs resolution since the #1 use for the Echo devices is music.

We did it because it had a built-in smart home hub.  Previously, we had used IRIS from Lowes, and when they went out of business, we switched to Smartthings, which used both Zigbee and Z-wave.  Well, same old story, they started using a third party to make their hardware and after months of fidgeting with it, I threw it all away and got this.  Of course, I had to switch most of my Z-wave over to Zigbee, including wall switches, the door lock, etc.  Luckily, I can do all that stuff myself.  When I plugged in the new Echo, lo and behold, everything just came together.  I had about an hour of fussing with the one wall switch, until I realized what I had done wrong.  But then, it just discovered all our items, added them to lists, let me build routines lickety split!  It was very refreshing to have things just come together.  And if I set an alarm at night, the Echo will ask me if I want to lock the front door, knowing that I'm getting ready for bed.  It lets me access my smart home items from any Alexa app, including my car, phone, computer, and all the Echoes about the house.  I'm tired of switching protocols from Z-wave to Zigbee and back and I wanted something that would last.  I almost went with just a straight Wifi for everything, but I'm really glad I didn't.  Folks, this thing is stupid simple, even for people who aren't versed in smart home equipment.  And it functions in every way just as well or better than the previous Echoes did.  It would even link to my smart home appliances, if I had those models.  And it works well with my NEST smoke detector and my Ring door bell and cameras.  Next step: putting in some smart thermostats.  The only thing I haven't messed with is some IFTTT protocols.  I used to have the old system set up so that if the Ring detected motion and the lock detected tampering, it would turn on all the lights, continue recording on the Ring, and alert my phone.  I'll repost if I get that to work for me.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

This is my third basic Echo (in addition to an Echo Studio, several Echo Dots, and the version for your car).Positives:This one picks up commands easily even from the next room over without me having to raise my voice.It controls my smart lights, smart outlets, motorized blinds, and other convenient features, and many items interface very smoothly so that installation of new devices is typically easy.  Not always, but often.Negatives:The spherical design doesn't ""blend into the woodwork"" and takes up more shelf space than the previous cylindrical versions.The system isn't very good at presenting information outside the fairly narrow range of skills.  Ask it to play a song from the Amazon library or to ""Tell me about my commute"" (after specifying the location when you set up that skill), and it's helpful.  Ask it the sort of general information question that you might input into Google, and it will probably tell you it doesn't know that.  (I assume that the Google system would do better in this respect.)It's programmed to offer you ""help"" that you didn't ask for which is irritating--mostly the opportunity to buy stuff.  ""BTW, did you know that you can ask me to automatically order blah blah blah?"" as an addition to whatever you did ask it to do.  Yes, I do know that, and I don't appreciate having to tell it to stop playing what amounts to an ad for other Amazon products or services.The fact that there are only a few ""wake words"" is a problem in a household with multiple devices.  It would be better if the user could input their own choice of a wake word that they would be unlikely to use in general conversation.I'm not impressed with the sound fidelity of this system.  It's better than the Dot's, but not by a whole lot.  The Studio version is much, much better (but also much more expensive).  To my ear, it doesn't sound as good as the second cylindrical version we own.  That was disappointing, and is probably a direct result of having fewer speakers than previous versions.  If listening to music is going to be a primary use, you're going to need to fuss with Bluetooth speakers or spring for the Studio version.\n",4 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Each edition has improved in sound quality. I would argue that the 4th gen is significantly better than the 3rd. I have compared them side by side with different styles of music (rock, metal, pop, hip-hop, jazz, electr\xf3nica).I can attest (with picky speaker preferences for casual music listening) that these are well worth the price if bought on sale. Are they worth $100 if you\u2019re only buying them for audio purposes? Maybe not. But I haven\u2019t found any comparable $100 speakers. Not that I\u2019ve researched that price range a ton. IMO, these are the most powerful, full and clear sounding speakers you can get in that price range. When on sale for $75, with additional promotions, I\u2019ve been able to buy two of them for under $60 each. I can say they make me one happy music enjoying dude. When I want to REALLY hear hi-fi quality audio, I turn to other audio devices I own. But, I most frequently put music on my Echo when I get home, am lounging around, or doing inside house work. Now for smart home shtuff\u2026SMART HOMEI honestly haven\u2019t yet found reliable smart Home tech that doesn\u2019t require same-brand loyalty and medium to high cost. I\u2019ve tested a few bulbs, smart plugs, and that\u2019s about it. So, I\u2019m not the best resource for this info. But, I will say that with Amazon smart plugs, the Echo speakers have been about 95% reliable. 5% of the time, there is a lag or no following of the command (e.g. Alexa, turn off living room lights). So, I\u2019m content with that. If I had other smart home tech that was voice command operated, I would expect 99% or higher efficacy. Hence I haven\u2019t really invested or put much effort into obtaining more smart home tech.OVERALLIf you\u2019re looking for a great speaker and basic smart home tech in this price range, I think this speaker is for you. If you\u2019re wanting hi-fidelity audio or better smart home tech, you\u2019re likely going to need a bigger budget or to keep hunting that white whale (Moby Dick reference\u2026I haven\u2019t read much of it, but call me Ishmael.

It's smaller than I expected and It makes the new Dot seem large! But the sound is very good for such a small and inexpensive package. I think it's great that it's not 360 degree audio anymore as I have almost never seen one not installed near a wall.  Additionally, the 1/4"" mounting hole (1/4-20 threaded like a tripod) is absolutely fantastic. I have mine mounted using a cheap security camera mount but you can use almost any tripod, arm or mount due to the ubiquity of this mounting size.I was especially interested in the Aux-In / Line-in capabilities. The Echo only has one audio port and you can switch it between output and input. (If you're planning on using it for output only, though, a dot might be a better choice for you if you don't need zigbee) I'm using the port as an input and it's not quite as full-featured as I'd like.Here are some facts from my limited testing and use you may find helpful.- The line-in needs a strong/loud signal. The headphone port from my Mac mini comes out too softly even when the Echo, Mini and all software volumes are at max. I mean, it's loud enough at that, but then Alexa is SO LOUD it's unusable. I also tested from my iPad Pro with a USB C hub that had audio out and found similar low levels. I don't have a proper line-level output device handy. Unfortunately this level problem makes it unusable for my original purpose unless I add an amp. (Otherwise, great computer speaker!)- The line-in needs to be activated in the Alexa app. By default the port is line-OUT. Look under settings for your device.- The line-in is mixed with Alexa audio but is NOT MIXED with other audio sources, for instance streaming music services. Example: Play music from Spotify, ask Alexa something, you'll hear Alexa speaking over Spotify. Play audio from an external source via the line-in and the Spotify audio will stop and the external audio plays. Ask Alexa something and you'll hear the response over the line-in audio. Start Spotify again and the external audio will mute and Spotify will play. You cannot seem to mix external audio and a streaming source simultaneously. So far the auto switching between seems to be inconsistent.- The port is a little tight to the edges of the recess in the housing. A cable with a large connector may not make a good connection.I'll be putting this to work elsewhere and hope that I can use it as a computer speaker if the level issue is ever addressed. (I know, bluetooth to it, but the latency is poor)\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

If you try to pair your phone via Bluetooth and play, it will ONLY play through the single echo (no sub, no second echo)2. Pairing trick - immediately after setting up my sub or 2nd echo, I could not for the life of me, pair them to my existing echo. Apparently, you have to wait about 5-10mins before you can pair them together. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s some discovery process so they can see each other on the local network.

I originally wanted the Echo Studio but it's not been available for months now so I decided to get this Echo Premium sound.  When I first hooked it up in the living room on an end table I honestly was not impressed and was going to take that one back as well.  But!  I wanted to listen to music in the bathroom so I hooked it up in there and wow- it sounded like a different speaker all together it was sitting higher than it was on the living room end table and was also in a corner those two details transformed the sound.  It's sound quality is on par but just slightly under the Sonos One @ $220 but when you think of the big price difference it makes the Sonos not worth the price.  If you had $200 to spend on speaker I would buy two of the Echo 4 Premium sound speakers that makes a stereo pair and for sure would sound better than one Sonos One. I always thought the Echo Studio would be closer paired to the Sonos but I think it's actually closer to the Echo 4 Premium. Another reason that I like it better is you can play music through out your house on any Echo devices.  With the Sonos it has to be another Sonos product to play throughout house.  In my bedroom I have an Echo dot that is connected to my very favorite Logitech Z625 400 watt 2.1 THX certified speakers so I can still get the bass from the subwoofer in the bathroom that makes the Echo sound that much better.  I'm glad I gave it a chance before returning.  Another tip is make sure you set the equalizer to your liking adjusting that makes a huge difference.\n,,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Most smart products will need an update out of the box. Well, all you do is tell Alexa to update herself. Done!

What else can I say? Sounds great, simple to setup, easy to use. Oh, and did I tell you it integrates with your other wireless devices (like security systems, lights, etc.) through Alexa? Yeah, it does that! I bought a bunch of echos and put one in every room, now my house is a giant speaker with music coming from everywhere. Well, what are you waiting for?

I have a Fire TV, Sirius XM, Apple Music, Audible Books, etc. and I can just say say 'play this or play that' and Bam, the TV turns to what I say or the Dot plays in one, specific, or all rooms. Truly an amazing technological design with so many amazing features.There is so many great things about this device, but the engineers made 2 major flaws; the first flaw could be fixed through a software update, the second could be just a cheaply bought microphone or it could possibly fixed through some complex software coding and then updated on all of these devices. If this could be done, this would without a doubt be a 5 Star purchase with zero complaints. Let's see if they do something to fix this or if they are now going to make you buy the next Generation and this purchase was a pretty much a waste of money. Here are the 2 flaws that I have found so far.1) When Alexa talks, there is way too much bass to the voice and it makes it very hard to understand. Music is perfect, it is just when Alexa is answering questions making an announcement, telling you your reminder, etc.2) Also, as I've read in many reviews, when you say the 'Wake Words (Alexa, Echo, etc.), sometimes it will answer you from 20 feet away and sometimes I'm literally standing over it and I can't get it to do anything (it especially stinks when you ask it to do something and it misheard what you said and starts talking about a subject and I say Alexa over and over, louder and louder, and it won't stop going on and on about a topic I didn't ask for, yet I can't get it to stop. I have to pretty much yell to get the thing to shut up).\n",10 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I expected a small improvement but am amazed at the sound quality. You can control the equalizer by telling Alexa to raise or lower the bass, mid range and treble (Alexa set bass down to 4, set mid range up to 6) +6 or -6 settings for sound. The sound quality almost rivals my Bose and I am a finicky listener. We set it on the counter between the kitchen and living room to take advantage of the Omni directional sound. I understand that some folks are unhappy with it against a wall as they lose some sound quality so I do recommend setting it somewhere away from a wall. Oh, and with Alexa not hearing you.....if your volume is up pretty high you must shout. So, we found that if we manually turn the volume down Alexa can hear better and responds faster.

So far so good. The sound quality is good to my ears and I like the funky shape of the speakers.However, it was disappointing that I could not drive sound to both speakers from other than the Spotify app. So listening to sources like Audible and Apple Music wasn\u2019t possible. The best I could do was connect to one of the speakers via Bluetooth. But that defeated the stereo separation and fuller sound I wanted.I finally settled on this workable an inexpensive solution:1. I purchased a Bluetooth to Stereo adapter. I got this one https://smile.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B078J3GTRK?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title2. I also purchased two RCA to 3.5 mm adapters. Together with #1 the cost was about $30.  https://smile.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B092RTHZPW?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title3. I plugged the left channel output from the Bluetooth adapter (using cables I had) to the Echo on the left and the right channel output to the right Echo.4. Now when I want to listed to any iPhone app I connect the iPhone to the Bluetooth adapter and cast to the speakers.Once it\u2019s set up it\u2019s simple to switch to the speakers via Bluetooth giving me the full sound I want. I just have to power on the adapter and it automatically makes the Bluetooth connection.I did take off a rating star because I think Amazon should design their system so that stereo from any source is built in.

I did finally get them working (a few days later they sit magically realized they\u2019re on the same network). They sounds great. Bumped it from 2 to 4 stars. Would give 5 if it weren\u2019t for the below time wasting activity.I bought these to replace a 2nd gen Echo set.  I had lots of issues with the 2nd gen in stereo + sub mode.  Mostly related to the setup (next paragraph).  Usually if you can get them setup, they work mostly ok.  Every few hours one of them will start to just play static...which is more than moderately annoying.  Most of the time this can be fixed by saying Alexa, Stop and then Alexa play...  About 1/6 times it requires physically unplugging all three devices and then plugging them back in.  About 1/30 times they have to be unpaired and re-paired and that leads to the below nerdspeak.Setup: So we have a home network with multiple SSIDs overlaid on 3 Unifi-Pro-AC Access Points (highly recommend those btw).  However, every time I try to create a stereo + sub pair, once I click on the L or R speaker it tells me the R or L speaker is on a different wifi network (it isn't, all our IoT spyware devices are on one SSID/VLAN).  So I thought maybe I'll just disable all but the closest AP and turn on only 2.4GHz.  Note: this meant I had to drop like 50 other wireless clients, but I still did it, still got the same faux error.  Why I know this is an Amazon issue (and suspect it's the Alexa app specifically) is because the sub will pair just fine with either echo.  But yet the echos won't pair with each other.  Then days later, I looked again, and viola it let me pair them again.I googled for help, but all I found was a bunch of other users with the same issue but no resolution.  So I contacted Amazon, which was a waste of time.These may be fine speakers on their own, but if you plan to pair them in a stereo or stereo + sub set you're as likely as I was to be disappointed.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I've owned an 3rd gen echo dot for several years and just really wasn't thrilled about the muffled sounding voice of Alexa. I used the Dot in my living room but preferred the voice of another assistant as it was clearer and more crisp sounding with speech when asking about the weather or the news etc. The 3rd gen Dot was just ok for playing music. I watched videos on the new 4th gen Echo and they all raved about the bass and the loudness the 4th Gen Echo could produced. I will have to say it really surprised me how much bass and power it has. It is great for listening to music. The one downside I have found  is that the microphones seem to be on the weak side when I ask it to play a song or ask it a question. I have to be within 6 feet of the Echo for it to correctly hear what I am asking it to do. The 3rd gen echo dot I have can hear me from another room. I am not sure what is up with the microphones. I also have other assistants and they have no problem at all of hearing every word I speak. Seems to be a problem with the Echo.Another kind of annoying thing with the Echo is the WHITE POWER CORD. My Echo is Black and the white cord sticks out like a sore thumb. The Echo sits on my night stand and it just looks completely odd to see this black cloth covered ball sitting there with this bright white cord sticking out. And no i am not taking a black magic marker and coloring the cord as I have seen in other comments. MY 3rd gen echo dot at least came with a black power cord. My Echo Show 8 came with a black power cord. So for a $100.00 you would think they could color match the power cord to the product. They have done it with past products.It's great for playing music but I use my other assistants to control lighting etc. It's a $100.00 speaker for me.\n,,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Now, some things I learned:- Echo Show 5 has only two mics, and they're terrible. Put that in a room that is away from the rest, where there isn't any overlap.- Echo Spot gets very confused when connected to the old bluetooth speakers, and would oddly slow down Alexa's speech, and song speeds. Don't ask me how, but it did. But the old speakers are out of the equation now.- Fire Cube 4K will not join the ""everything"" sound group, but also isn't a terribly good speaker, so it's not a loss.- To have more robust sound, we kept an EchoDot in the same room with the new 4th-gen Echo, but changed its wake-word to ""Echo,"" to avoid confusion between them.- Fire Cube 4K's wake word was changed to ""computer"" for the same reason.- Echo 4th-gen is great in most respects, but may have slightly less responsive mics. I've had her wake, but then ignore my requests. It's a minor issue, and nowhere near as bad as the EchoShow 5.All-in-all, I'm pretty happy with the purchase, with my primary mission--whole house sound--solved. I figure I'll replace a Dot or two with these or other Echo speakers with more robust sounds as the months and years go by. I'll keep watching for sales. I got this one for 69.95, and it was very much worth it.\n",2 people found this helpful,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

I plugged it into the wall, the echo was detected by previously installed Alexa devices and it was all set up with a confirmation. Device is updated with a new processor which is supposed to improve the speed of response and commands.Pros:The addition of another tweeter to the new 4th Gen now fills the room with even more sound and provides more volume than previous generations.Sound mapping improves the sound quality based on room size and shape features.Temperature sensor now allows for more routine customization.Home theater setup: I currently have two of these paired with an echo sub to create a home theater 2.1 system through my Fire TV Cube.Internal Zigbee hub allows for a more integrated smart home experience, helps to lessen the bandwidth requirements of a smart home and improves the range for connected compatible devices through a Zigbee mesh network. (This is a largely desired improvement)Cons:Home theater setup: Despite having two Echo\u2019s paired, the volume does not seem to be twice as loud as one would expect. It seems as though the audio levels are capped when the devices are connected in a home theater setup. While the volume is still good for the 2.1 system and it fills the room, it doesn\u2019t seem to be far different than running one Echo at upper level volume. Also not capable of providing Dolby Atmos surround sound with Echo Gen. 4 as the paired speakers (Echo Studio required for this).While there is only one con on my list it is a fairly large con as I purchased two of these devices in order to build a quality home theater system.

It is indeed sending different signals to the left and right channels based on the music.I think it is pretty good for a home office. I did hear the Studio in the big box store last week and still might add one of those.Update: I would give 4.5 vs.perhaps a 3.8 earlier. It seems to adapt over time by perhaps learning your voice and acoustics as I moved it in the room.I had some credits with Amazon and decided to get this as it was on sale for $80- 25% trade in minus $5 dot trade in. So ~ $55 net. I was considering just getting a Echo Studio but the purpose of this is to sit on my floor and  sometimes listen to music during the work day.  My main Amazon/Alexa music listening to these days is through my Yamaha YAS109 and sometimes my Sonos One.The setup was easy, much better than years ago - just opened the app and it connected. No more, password, pressing two buttons at once.  I would agree that there have been a few ocassions I needed to repeat myself though as others have mentioned.I was surprised by how much bass there was- I am in the process of adjusting the EQ on the app. I have tried it out with some classic rock and disco.  I don't think the unit is earth shattering but for a casual listening experience while playing softly while WFH I think this has a lot of potential.I will see if repositioning it changes my opinion higher. I have a Echo Studio 5- i think this does have clearer vocals .UPDATE: It is sounding better maybe it does recognize the room/small area with my voice.I A/B'd it compared to my Sonos One and obviously one sonos one might sound better but this is decent i can even hear it in the next room where I am writing this.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

Aside from usual things that comes with having Alexa assist you, you also get a much needed room temperature that is also integrated.

I purchased the Echo for music while showering.  I'm impressed enough to write this review.  Now, if AMAZON considered reasonable trade-in values for older Echo Dots, I'd consider upgrading all the Dots I have around the house.  This Echo makes me wonder what the Echo Studio sounds like, but I can't bring myself to purchase an Echo Studio due to its cost; I also don't need one because my ""main music room"" has all the gear I need there.UPDATE:I had more than four (4) 2nd-generation DOTs, and tried the ECHO 4th-gen to replace my bathroom DOT for showers.  It works great in there, so I was moved to give the ECHO 4th-gen a positive review and went on to replace four (4) of my 2nd-gen DOTs with the 4th-gen ECHO.  First of all, these ECHO 4th-gens are very sensitive to position in terms of the sound.  I tolerated it.  (They sound much better than the DOTs.)  The MAIN PROBLEM with the ECHO 4th-gen is it DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO LISTEN.  Sometimes the one in the living room didn't even acknowledge I was talking to it!  (You can tell by the light not coming on.)  And oftentimes it wouldn't hear me, and another ECHO or DOT would answer!  So sometimes it wouldn't listen; other times it got the meaning of the words wrong; and yet other times it couldn't negotiate with the other ECHOs and DOTs ""within earshot"" as to which device should respond!  If this ECHO was defective, then all of them are defective: they all do the same goofed-up-listening thing.  I have since replaced the living-room ECHO 4th-gen with the old 2nd-gen DOT.  Now I have sane listening in my living room again.  I ""complained"" to AMAZON (oh how I complained) via ""I have feedback"" of course to no avail: AMAZON would have to acknowledge their design goof, which they continue to sell ""as is.""  There is something wrong with the voice pickup in these 4th-gen ECHOs.  It was aggravating enough for me to ""downgrade"" the 4th-gen ECHO to a 2nd-gen DOT.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Also quick and easy to sync with the Fire TV stick, now this Echo along with another Echo Dot work together like a home theatre.  Super cool!!\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

They don\u2019t interfere with my Bower & Wilkins Formation sound system.My only complaint is Bluetooth airplay (Apple Music, Tidal) allows my iPhone to connect to only one Echo at a time so it\u2019s not possible to grab them and go as a portable stereo sound system. They need WiFi and the Alexa App to pair them.Amazon Music App works well and if you have the Formation, Apple Music and Tidal skills installed in the Amazon Alexa App you can figure out how to tell Alexa to play music from any skill source to any Alexa sound room or Formation sound stage.I will test them with WiFi off to see it it\u2019s possible to set them up and pair them using only Bluetooth and the iPhone Apps to see if I can get AirPlay to stream Bluetooth from Apple and Tidal music Apps to both Echo\u2019s as a pair. I swear my initial setup outside on the deck had my Airplaying to both speakers in stereo. The next day, my iPhone rejected the saved Bluetooth device and when I detected and reattached I was able to connect to each speaker one at a time with no way to hear stereo mode without Amazon Music or telling Alexa via WiFi.How they seemed to work via Airplay outside Amazon Music/Alexa on Bluetooth then wouldn\u2019t the next day is a mystery.Then how my Amazon Music App seemed to be broken with no way of changing speakers and other quirky things suddenly got better after I agreed to purchase Music HD is another mystery. Suddenly an AirPlay came alive in Amazon Music that now allows me to AirPlay to any Amazon sound room and also my Formation sound stages.I haven\u2019t tried Bluetooth to one Echo then 3.5mm wire to second Echo to see if they work as left and right speaker. I hear this works, but it doesn\u2019t allow a Echo Sub to connect in this Bluetooth setup.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Actually liked it so much that the second one arrived and was installed today. Overall we like this latest gen. Both replaced units were gen 2 echos and it was time. You could tell she\u2019s just tired. But they\u2019re willing to give me $30 each for the core, I\u2019m good.Been playing with the one for at least a week. I do see some differences with it that I\u2019m attributing to the placement of the mics etc. We both like the light on the bottom and the overall design. We haven\u2019t run into any of the problems I\u2019ve read in the feedback like low volume etc. I think part of that is now they have the capability to speak louder if they detect ambient noise. That seems to work fine but I found that the normal voice seems a little lower than I would like and had to bump up the volume by a tick. But really this is just about fine tuning and certainly nothing to have a coronary about! When it starts making calls to the Kremlin without my permission then I\u2019ll have a complaint! (Jk I hope). Oh one thing that I really love is that there is a temp sensor in the unit. Love that because I keep a close eye on my hvac system.

This 4th generation with premium sound is awesome!

As a speaker it's really nice the sound is much better than my older bose soundtouch systems and my Google speakers which is strange because it's so much smaller its hilarious ive found to embrace the size as an advantage and am getting used to it the up firing speaker placement seems to work better than forward firing and I feel it fill my room better than my previous speakers at a comparable volume.  The volume it self is crazy loud i don't see my self ever using it anywhere over 75% its nice to have the option to go that loud i guess but the volume controls are some what limited unless you resort to voice commands since the app is pretty laggy. The app is something that definitely needs work but thats expected it can be frustrating at times and I did have some issues durring set up where my speaker would lose connection with the app causing a longer than expected set up. I've also noticed lag when using the app to control music or audio books with the app sometimes crashing and causing the speaker to stop playing but I've only experienced this when using the alexa app and using the specific app like audible and amazon music and controlling it from there has been much smother. The voice commands work perfectly its much more responsive than my older generation Google speaker and I haven't had any times where it has misunderstood me or been unable to complete a voice command. Voice commands is where the echo really shines its so convenient and responsive with executing every task ive asked it whether controlling my fire tv, playing music, searching for specific information, and making calls has all worked flawlessly voice commands is by far the best way to control the echo.

Improved features!,"\nI've owned 3 Echo Dot devices for around 2+ years.  Thought they were very handy and speedy enough for streaming music and accomplishing other things in a smart home.  They even work well to answer trivia questions should you have a curious mind wishing to learn about things.  Sound quality was ok but nothing to write home about.  Connecting them to a good quality Bluetooth speaker was the ticket.  I've found the best solution was to connect the external Bluetooth speaker to the Echo Dot with a 3.5 mm quality cable (if possible) and that would then leave the Bluetooth connection available for a phone or tablet.  Otherwise, you waste the cable audio input and defeat other features available through the Bluetooth Network connection to the Echo Dot.  I digress...The Echo 4th Gen has very respectable sound quality even at low volume.  The Alexa software with bass, midrange, and treble adjustments enable fine tuning of the sound quality.  The  3.5mm connection port is now both in and out.  Same thing for Bluetooth - in or out.  The WiFi capability is further enhanced with an upgrade to AC class so it can connect at 800 + megabit for streaming Hi-Res audio with no lag at all.  A bit overkill for audio only.  I imagine Amazon device engineers figured AC 5 Ghz would be necessary since it also has Higbee hub capabilities that may need lots of processing and the associated network bandwidth capabilities to other devices.  I could go on and on about this new Gen4 Echo.  At the current holiday sale price with free included options, it is a huge STEAL.  I've purchased 5 of these devices as Christmas presents.  4 of them with the 2 smart Hue Led lightbulbs and a fifth one to use as a stereo pair for a relative.

I've tried new spots in the room all to no avail. Its quite frustrating given how great the Dot worked.Other than the poor mic, the sound is rich and full even at moderate volume.

Since the Echos is about 2 feet away and cube is 6 feet away, when I ask Alexa to turn on the TV it tells me not supported and to enable that feature. My TV is not Alexa compatible but works with the cube no issues. This being the Echo it is really loud the treble sounds a bit muffled. I am used to HiFi stereos and surround sound so sound could be better, but otherwise it is really nice. The sphere design leaves something to be desired. I have to mute the mic on the echo to get the cube tv to work, I can also change the name of the device to solve the issue as well and may try that.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

What so many people don\u2019t mention is, if you\u2019re starting off to make your home a smart home, you\u2019ll maybe need a Bridge or Hub that can utilize Zigbee, Z-Power or Thread. Google Hub isn\u2019t actually a hub that can support those radios and the hubs can be about $50-$100 on their own. So Echo 4 comes with a hub to use for smart locks, bulbs, cameras, doorbells etc and it has Airplay!!Sound of the device is pretty amaze considering the price. Deep rich bass, nice highs and mids. No distortion. I had to put a grip to the bottom of the 4 because it would vibrate off the shelf if I didn\u2019t, but I was listening to VERY bass heavy music (Bassnectar)Set up was as easy as plugging it in and opening the app. I think that was it. Once it was set up the app let me know the 4 wanted to set up my lights and with a click, it set both of them up!Alexa routines are amazing for automation  Alexa, Good night  turns my lights off, activates my alarms, schedules my lights to gradually come on to a specific brightness gradually over a set time, tells me my appointments for tomorrow and the weather, tells me sweet Dreams, and plays sounds of rain.I haven\u2019t had to use the buttons on it yet. Voice works too well for me to need to press buttons yet.Drop in works very well and both the caller and I can hear one another near perfectlyEcho 4 and 3 aren\u2019t able to be paired together to make a stereo set, but you can use the 3 and 4 in the same house, group, room and they work like they should.Still reading up on the tons of things I can get automated now that I have a hub, smart speaker with airplay. Set up is darn close to being as if it was ready the moment I opened its box and plugged it in\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

And as capable as it is, and as compatible with as many things as it is, they push software updates all the time.Excellent voice recognition, quicker than previous version.And the sound is MUCH better than previous generations.Don't let anyone tell you (like those you tube reviews) ""it is the same driver""> IT IS NOTWhat they mean is, ""it is the same diameter"". But there is SO much more to a speaker than just the diameter.The cone is lighter and stiffer, it has a die cast aluminum ""basket"" instead of a stamped sheet metal one. I haven't taken the speaker completely apart so I haven't checked the voice coil, but the magnet is also much heavier. The surround (annulus) seems more pliant.All this results in better sound.This model has two dome tweeters for slightly better mids and highs and better directionality in both mono and especially stereo modes.Of course it isn't a replacement for a home stereo, and it is was never meant to be. It's just meant to fill a room with sound when you're not critically listening.Another thing is that the new generation also is made out of mostly recycled parts.Of course Alexa is much better than siri and almost on par with goog when doing queries and she's getting better every day\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I found this to be a bit disappointing as I got used to the quality of the voice recognition and the previous version. the voice recognition quality appeared to degrade after an update. I do hope they fix this. The sound quality however is excellent.  I've been using it with basic Amazon music service and that's been more than enough for me. I have multiple devices so when I tell it to play music everywhere I hear music throughout my home playing simultaneously. It also connects to various podcasts and online radio stations.One feature that I do like is the built-in thermostat. I'm able to use that to trigger other  devices such as a portable heater, which are plugged into smart plugs, to turn off and on in a room when the temperature is above or below a certain range.The ability to call people through the device is that nice bonus.i It is not using your cell phone which I found to be a bit creepy but it will put your cell phone number as a number that is being dialed so it is effectively spoofing your phone. Basically you could put any phone number there in the account online  to be dialing from and it will use it.The user interface for Alexa integration is quite frankly confusing. I write computer systems for a living it took me quite a while to figure out the integration. I think the average user will give up on many of the integration features because of this difficulty. I should be able to talk to the device directly to create a routine and not be clicking through an application with confusing menus.Overall it's still a great piece of technology and I highly recommend it.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

I am a big music/music quality person and these have made a massive difference. I rarely even use my JBL speaker now because the quality in these is actually even better than that!!i do wish there was sort of a travel option like most other bluetooth speakers, since sometimes i like to take them outside or to an area where plugs are not accessible. i wish there was a way around this that was not overly complicated or required purchasing another object.  Otherwise i would recommend to anyone who loves alexa products but was missing the sound quality of the dot.to summarize: for someone who is not super into music, the echo dot is a more ""appropriate"" size and music quality is good enough.for someone who appreciates/is into music: the echo is SO worth the investment. it is significantly bigger than the dot, but i dont find that it looks ridiculous, just takes some getting used to - because the bigger size is so worth the sound quality difference.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

The big echo is about ten feet away from my regular seat on the couch, and the echo dot is about thirty feet away, give or take, in the dining area on our open floor plan downstairs. The dot always hears me better than the big echo does. Always. I seldom have to raise my voice to the dot but I do for the echo. It does understand me okay when it hears me, though. Most of the time I wind up talking to the dot in the kitchen, though, because it hears me better, and only speak to the Echo when I want it to play music.That said, the sound quality is noticeably better with the bigger echo, especially when it comes to bass. The dot is good, especially for a casual listener like me, but if you want better bass the echo is a good option. In our little condo it's loud to me at volume 6/10 and we generally keep the volume at 3 or 4.It has a temperature sensor inside which is kinda fun but we don't have a smart thermostat so it's not a big selling point for me. I'm new to smart home stuff, so I haven't bothered figuring out the ZigBee thing yet.I bought it on Prime Day, and for what I paid then I'm content. If you already have a dot and you're just looking for better sound, though, it might be worth it to you to spend the extra on the Echo Studio. We don't have it but a relative does, and the sound out of that is really nice.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Of course it lacks true stereo separation, but that is hardly noticed with the 2 separate tweeters at 45 degree angle to each other.This is a great way to stream music in HD and UHD as Echo 4 plays in this cd-quality format, better than mp3 quality for sure.UPDATE: Voice recognition while loud music is playing is not as good as the 2nd generation, which is very sensitive during loud music or TV. With the TV at normal listening level, I have to almost yell to get the new Echo to hear what I am saying.My opinion is that this one is great for pop music, which doesn't require as great sound as, say, symphonic music. I listened to a Mahler symphony with this Echo and the sound quality was quite good, suitable for background listening to classical. My high fidelity Onkyo system and speakers of course sound better, and a high quality sound system is required for serious classical listening. Still, this is a good unit and replaces my 1st gen living room Echo. The comparison here is phenomenal.The new HD 2009 remastered Beatles albums sound great with Echo 4!Also, it works with non-Amazon music streamers though it requires a paid subscription to Amazon Music HD to access them!I like the globe-shape design.

It doesn't work. The smart phone app is very difficult to follow in attempting to set up. After numerous attempts, this echo 4 simply sits on the shelf. I will probably return. Amazon customer service tech support is non existent. I have the echo 3 which works fine. This echo actually cannot handle the density of bits and bytes in a dense classical piece of music and audibly skips whole seconds of music because its small processor is weak. This is not an issue for the majority of buyers who listen to hip hop and the like. The echo 3 has no problem with this issue whatsoever. Amazon does not read or use these reviews, so it really doesn't matter, because amazon is so big, it could care less. I suspect that a it is rarely a good idea to buy electronics from amazon because most of it is knock offs and junk.Within 10 minutes of submit this review, I was stunned that an amazon tech employee called me out of the blue! I have to swallow my words now. This cheerful man helped me and within minutes the Echo 4 worked perfectly and was all set up!  Of course, Bezos (soon to be happily launched into space where he can stay) does give this kind of diligent employee, as well as others, the work conditions and th raises they need to make a living.

This little wonder provides plenty of bass and rich tones to fill a room. What's more, its voice recognition is marvelous and I'm guessing the spherical shape of the unit has a lot to do with that. Even while playing music at high volume, it recognizes my commands. No need to shout over the music. (It's almost scary how well it hears, despite significant, competing sounds.)Connectivity to my Alexa SmartHome was quick and seamless. Easy-peasy. I recommend purchasing the recharging mount/stand, as shown in the pic and available here on Amazon. Simply unplug the AC cord after charging and the unit is portable/wireless anywhere within the home where WiFi is accessible--for up to five hours.All in all, the Echo 4th Gen exceeds my expectations. As for issues of privacy that have surrounded this device and others since their inception? There are a number of ways to protect yourself if you are concerned--ways that I won't delineate here. Do your settings homework and you'll see that Amazon can learn as little or as much about your household as you permit. As for me and mine? I employ a few such settings but I'm not paranoid about it. The benefits that the Alexa suite of products provide me far outweigh any concerns I might have about privacy intrusion. Again, take the time to learn about the product and configure your devices to suit your needs AND protect your family's information.

Needs hearing aids.,"\nSince wink has pretty much gone belly up and started charging to use it I decided it was time to put it to bed. Since I already have numerous dots, spots, and shows I decided the best idea was to go with the echo hub. I have a Phillips hue hub and numerous bulbs which connected very easily. I also have several switches that were mostly Z-wave so those all had to be replaced with Kasa zigbee switches which also installed very easily. My back door lock is a Schlage Connect but it was also Z-wave so I had to replace that with a Schlage Connect zigbee and that installed much easier than the Z-wave. I have to agree with everyone that it\u2019s ridiculous they ship a white power cable with a charcoal unit. Luckily my cable is mostly hidden. I thought I could possibly use a power cable from one of the old dots but they all work on different amp outputs. I also have to agree that this thing needs an improvement on it\u2019s microphone. I have this installed in my kitchen and normally have to call it my name several times to get it to respond whereas one of my shows is in the living room and I can easily get it to respond from the kitchen. Overall it was much easier to install and maintain than the wink hub. A word of advice. If you have a wink hub and you want to change to this hub make sure that you delete all of your devices from your wink app, unlink everything in the wink settings, remove the app from your phone and disable the wink skill. Otherwise Alexa Will reinstall them automatically and you will have to delete them all every time it does. Speaking from experience.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

You most likely had those set up as your ""main"" echo device and didnt bother to reset it to this ""new"" device. You have to assign the new echo as the main one. The device can hear you just fine, but you still have your previous device set as the speaker used to answer.Read the tutorials to best set up your device for multiple rooms because 9 out of 10 times youve missed a step.with that said this device soundS PHENOMENAL. Its no surround sound system and wont replace a stereo system (but could if you buy 2 echos plus a subwoofer and link them all into a right and left +sub audio stereo system!!) but it sounds better than any of the top of the line bluetooth devices I have. the bass is great, the mids are spot on and the trebles/highs are great. You can set them to your liking if youre not happy with any or prefer a different sound but in my opinion the sounds is fantastic.Ive had no issues with her recognizing my voice, I did however suffer the issue above (she would respond on my older speakers) but once i figured out how to reset up my rooms its all perfect now.I havent gotten a chance to use the zigbee hib only because i already have two other hubs set up and im too lazy to to restart everything under zigbee since its all working fine with my hue a gosund apps, maybe some day.Id recommend this over the dot or older echo any day of the week\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

There is no question that this is an upgrade from the prior version.I think the sound quality is great. Have you gone in to the Alexa app and individually adjusted the audio settings for the device? You can adjust the bass, treble, and mid range within the app, similar to how you would do so on your car radio; I\u2019m wondering if those that have commented so negatively about the sound quality knew or did that.Admittedly, I thought the sound was too bass heavy at first. Went in to the settings, and naturally each of the three audio settings were at zero, so I bumped the mid range and treble all most all the way up, and the bass just one more mark. Really evened out the sound, and I got to dancing quicklike. I take that as a good omen though that I thought it was bass heavy when the setting was on zero (it was just that the treble and midrange were too).  Seems to speak the quality of the small sub in there.  And I haven\u2019t noticed much difference, if any yet regarding the direct sound vs prior 360 sound. Pretty room filling still. I\u2019m looking forward to testing it out with the fire cube eventually.Setup was seemless, even rearranging three other, older devices and getting \u201cplay everywhere\u201d set back up.  The new echo had no problem reconnecting with my various smart devices, maybe took a couple of minutes at most.So, yeah, so far, nothing but good things to say.

This is my first 4th generation Echo or Echo Dot and I have to say, I am not a fan of the sphere form factor. The sphere has a bigger physical footprint which is an issue on a space constrained counters. I also don't like the status indicator LED ring at the bottom of the sphere.

It gives the impression of a mismatch (white cord, black unit\u2026weird!).After 3 days I\u2019m beginning to notice small problems. For example, when I stop music, there is a \u201ccrack\u201d sound, as if someone pulled the plug on the speaker, rather than a clean power down. Also, I\u2019ve had to find a spot not too high and not too low so she hears me. Which was annoying because I had to get out of bed to adjust her height, while I was lying in bed, then again the next day when I was moving about. I think I found a happy medium. But again it was annoying.Oh, and if you\u2019re the nervous about your info type person, Echo might not be for you! She required permissions to anything and everything in order for you to take full advantage of the fun and benefits of using this smart speaker.Should I discover any more pros or cons that I think might be helpful, I\u2019ll add here.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Not that I feel they are completely safe now but will trust that Amazon will continue to protect us the best they can. After watching a friend use a different brand, it was totally helpful while baking cookies over Christmas, having the gadget set timers galore by just speaking. That sold it for me. lol.So far I like all that I've done with it except the issue my partner has getting Alexa to listen. Setting timers with no response back is frustrating. Then you feel like you have to yell. Though I never have issues when I speak to her. Not sure why it has difficulties listening to one person but not another. I wondered in the beginning if she had hearing troubles if other noises were happening around her or nearby.Anyway I am still excited to try everything else out. Kind of wanna get the bulbs now and a security camera. lol.I purchased two of them and found we really only needed one. But Amazon is making be pay for shipping or I have to find a UPS store for it to be free to send back. I felt that was kind of unfair. We have drop off places that are convenient but not any actual stores. So I rather not lose money by having to pay to return. Who knows maybe having two will eventually come in handy.

Other Echos I have are a 1st Gen Echo, a 1st gen Dot and a Show 5.I purchased the Gen 4 to replace my really early (pre-release/invite-ony) Gen 1 Echo. The Gen 1 still works fine and has been moved to another room. After a couple of hiccups setting up, the Gen 4 seems to be working fine. I had to reboot/reset it a couple of times to get the temperature sensor to calibrate, and I had to add/remove it from a group several times to get Guard to work.Pros: Obviously the addition of a Zigbee Hub is nice and the temperature sensor will be handy when I start upgrading my home thermostats to ""smart"" units. The Gen 4 seems to understand my commands more consistently and from greater distance. The audio quality is much improved over the Gen 1, even at low volume, especially the bass response.  Unfortunately, the bass gets a bit ""muddy"" at higher volume.Cons: I miss the volume twist-ring of the gen 1 and while the light ring at the bottom of the Gen 4  orb gives more of an ambient glow when activated, the top-mounted ring was more visible. The diameter of the orb is nearly twice the diameter of the cylinder, so it may affect placement for some people. Oh, and the power cord -- not only is it WHITE on a Charcoal colored device, but it is too short -- at least a foot shorter than the Gen 1 cord. (and they're not interchangeable.)Overall, I'm pleased with the new Echo, especially for the current (Dec 2020) sale price. It's worth the upgrade from an early Echo maybe not so much from an later one.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I have six echos in my house.  included in these isn are a  Echo 1t Gen and the Echo 2nd Gen, which were the two I was considering upgrading.  After reading all the Amazon reviews, I was concerned about three things that were usually noted in negative reviews.  1.  White power cord.  2.  Voice response.  3.  Sound quality with respect to comparing with the previous echos.  Now that I've had them, (I bought two), for a few days, I am prepared to respond to those comments.1.  White power Cord - Who cares?  It works and isn't an eye sore.  If it bothers you maybe you can take a Sharpie and color it black.2.  Voice response - A few reviews stated that the new Echo didn't respond as quickly and lacked a tad when music was playing.  I found this not be be true.  It responds as quickly as the previous echos, even with music playing.3.  Sound quality - These new echos promise better sound.  I found this to be true.  It definitely has better sound than the previous echos.  They are loud and the bass is quality.  I am very happy with the sound as this is the only way I listen to music in my house.So, overall, I am glad I bought two new echos.  They are awesome and the most important thing to me is the quality sound.  I am very satisfied and recommend anyone that is thinking of buying one, or upgrading an older echo, please do so.  You'll be very happy.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

The reactive bottom lighting is a great feature as well. Sort of reminds me of Kit from Knight Rider. Like you can tell it's thinking by the motion and color of the light.My only gripe is that you cannot access your YouTube music account. I'm positive this is because Google, whom owns YouTube, would rather you buy a Google smart device, so I switched to Amazon HD Music player. I'm new to the app so I'm still on the fence as to whether it's better or worse for music, although Amazon being HD music seems to have a little better quality. But YouTube has video, while Amazon does not. So if I have to get rid of YouTube Red I will miss being able to watch videos with no commercials. Unless I keep both, but all of these streaming services are starting to add up to a lot of bills.But overall, I'd say the Alexa device is one of the more attractive and high end sounding speakers available, especially when considering it was on sale for only $79. At that price, when it cones to sound quality, it's a little clearer sounding than my JBL Charge 2 $350 Bluetooth speaker. The Amazon doesn't get as loud as the JBL, but at mid and lower volume it sounds noticeably clearer.The AI, Alexa seems to give better and more detailed answers than my Google devices.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I wasn't too fond of having a smart speaker and smart things but when your in bed at night and you just got comfortable she saves the day. Also using her to make phone calls is so much easier then using your phone just tell her who to call and she calls . That also goes for hanging up. Meanwhile use your phone for other things. I would recommend this. There is no question about how loud it gets or sound quality. The last thing I would say is if you don't think you need a hub or don't want one, this speaker is for you then because it already has one built in and zigbee is popular. It leaves that door open for so many devices. Watch one day you'll find a zigbee device and you'll remember that you have a built in hub.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

The 4th generation is a big disappointment; the placement of the microphone in the bottom (rather than the top as in earlier generations) makes it much less sensitive to voice command.  Frequently an older ECHO in a more distant room will respond to a command made directly to the 4th generation (while standing right in front of it.). Tried placing on a tripod (to raise the microphone) but no improvement.  For the best deal, the ""dot"" is best.  For best sound, the first or second generation is good (even bought a refurbished one which works great).  The Echo-plus w/ subwoofer is best for overall sound, but again, less sensitive to voice commands.  Sometimes with the Echo 4th generation, I honestly just miss the radio.  Or streaming thru my computer.  Terrible device.Follow up-got a call from Amazon and used the command button on top (round circle w/ circle inside) to reset the ""awake"" command.  Apparently some of these had sensitivity problems from the factory - but pushing the command/reset button for just a second allows the device to download an improved voice recognition system.  Much better now, so have revised up to 4 stars.  Put the device in our shop and walked outside to give awake command - worked fine.

The only thing that upsets me is how she isn\u2019t very well integrated with Apple Music. She can play public playlists that Apple produces and such but she can\u2019t play your own personal playlists. One other thing that disappoints me is that she can connect to a wide variety of Bluetooth speakers except for LG speakers. When setting up speakers it gives you options for tons of name brand companies but LG isn\u2019t there. Fret not because there is an option to set up a Bluetooth speaker not specified(such as Lg) but when trying to connect to Bluetooth Alexa couldn\u2019t seem to find my speaker even when set to Bluetooth mode. She found other things such as printers and such. I will try manually plugging my Alexa into my speaker but the point of using Bluetooth is so the speaker and Alexa are in different parts of the room/house. Other than those two minor things Alexa is a very fun device and incredibly useful as well. When looking through reviews I notice a fair amount of people complain about audio quality compared to other alexas and I have to say that I have worked a fair share in the audio business and when listening to my friends gen 3 Alexa play music compared to the gen 4 is totally different. The gen 4 completely blows the gen 3 out of the water. It just sounds more full and crisp. And if you\u2019re a stickler for certain sound adjusts then simply ask Alexa for more bass of treble and whatnot.\n,,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

The sound quality (on the 4th generation device) is outstanding, the features and functions are excellent. The voice recognition is solid (most of the time). Yes, that's where this device falls short of perfect. I can be sitting right next to it and tell it turn off in a relatively loud voice and it won't turn off. On the other hand, I can be in another room and tell it the same command and most of the time it turns off. My guess is that the design takes away the omni-directional microphones and replaces them with microphones set withing the mesh, which doesn't cover the entire unit. That's too bad because Amazon was first to market with digital assistants and to see them have a hiccup on their 4th gen device is a small (I mean small) disappointment.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

This is my first Echo I own, but I've seen 3rd Gen one on some of my friend's house and they were so excited to use it so I thought I'll give a try too (after an extensive research, as I was looking also at its direct competitor's offer, but now I'm really glad I've chosen Alexa).What is nice about 4th Gen is that it has a Zigbee hub (which was available previously on Echo Plus) and a temperature sensor built in, so I can always ask Alexa what is the current temperature in my room, which is great. I also have 2 Zigbee light bulbs paired directly with it in 2 separate rooms that could be easily controlled by voice or with Alexa app. Lately, I also bought an Aeotec Smart Things hub which Alexa handles nicely through SmartThings skill.Regarding the sound, I think it's great, the mids are crisp and the bass is rich and well contoured. I like very much that I can say ""Alexa, connect to my phone"" or my PC and I can play music on it within seconds via Bluetooth.I really like that Alexa is so smart and continuously learning from my voice and commands, and also I like that it recognizes my family members when they talk to it (my small daughter likes to ask how a particular animal sounds).I think Echo is a real benefit for elderly people or disabled ones, because so many things/commands can be done only by voice.In conclusion, I really love Echo 4th Gen, which has fast become a family companion. I fully recommend it!!\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

Particularly, an audio upgrade. The two options I was considering: an Echo Studio, or two Echo 4th Gens paired together with their stereo function.I ended up buying two Amazon Echo 4th Gens when they went on sale for Prime Day.They were easy enough to pair together. HOWEVER - the stereo function does not work when you are playing anything via a Bluetooth connection (or a hard cable connection, for that matter).The Echo stereo function apparently over works when playing stuff over WiFi. I would say this sounded quite wonderful; a really impressive audio setup. If you play music or podcasts via Amazon music (or another platform that plays via WiFi accessible through Alexa), I'd say this is a worthwhile audio system.The problem - when I played audio (both music and podcasts) from my iPhone via Bluetooth, the audio would come from only one speaker. Hence, no stereo. My personal audio world runs almost exclusively through my iPhone, so this was obviously an issue for me.So is just one speaker worth it? I'd say the audio from one Echo 4th Gen is definitely an improvement over the 2nd Gen Echo I have. Whether it's a worthwhile upgrade is up to your individual ear. For my part, I had my heart set on a substantially improved audio system, so I returned the 4th Gen and will hold out for the Echo Studio. (Now I just have to wait for it to go on sale).\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

I like streaming Spotify as well as use this as an external speaker for my home laptop.I like the overall build, and the volume easily fills a small to mid-sized room (my home-office).Alexa does respond faster on this with the new processer than it does on my SIL's Echo Dot 3.  I've had no issues with set-up, pairing etc.  I've had no problems with Alexa ""hearing"" my commands even when streaming music at a moderate volume.

No longer will I have to buy two of these for stereo sound.  The improvement in sound is absolutely outstanding with the price I paid being the same as with the older generation.  There is also major improvement to the subwoofer that allows for better bass when in use.  The sound edges the Echo Show 8 and is completely superior to the current generation Echo Show 5.  Against my older pair of Echo 2nd generations, this one speaker is an extreme improvement.  The microphone to pick up your voice is better at range than before, but since this is not a 360 speaker, you have to be within 110 degrees of the front and center for your voice to be recognized.  This is easily dealt with by proper placement.  I think this works best against a wall to force the acoustics to angle forward more.

I purchased two: one for my living room and one for my bedroom. The speaker I placed in my living room works well when I'm working from home. I use the speaker in my bedroom as a white noise machine for sleeping.Likes:* Rich bass for such a small speaker* Volume can get as loud as you'll likely want it. I've never tested the full range because anything above 70% will disturb my neighbors.* Alexa is pretty helpful, though I'm not a smarthome power user by an means* Integrates with Spotify, which I like much better than Apple music* Blends in to my furniture* Intelligent enough to detect which Echo I'm speaking to (bedroom vs. living room), and only play music or respond from that speaker.* Echo app store is a great idea that I didn't get with my Google home or Apple homepod. Didn't even know it existed before buying. I use the white noise app every night.Dislikes* The microphone is directional, so sometimes when I'm speaking to Alexa at an angle, it doesn't pick it up.* The ring of lights that announce when it's listening is facing down. If you place the Echo above eye level, you can't see it.* The white cord it comes with is pretty flimsy.

Overall audio quality is excellent compared to the Studios.Also, the response time is noticeably faster. Using the wake word (I use different ones for different units) causes these 4th gen Echos to light and listen so much faster than all previous gens. The single 4th gen Echo replaced a 3rd gen puck that would need to be unplugged and plugged back in regularly as it became less and less response to the ""Alexa"" wake word. This is important to me, since I use Alexa to control lights (WeMo/Lutron), fans (Big Ass Fans), thermostats (Nest) and stream audio throughout my home.Having gone through generations of Echos (starting with Gen1), it's apparent that some internal changes make a bigger difference in performance than is typically revealed by Amazon and in most reviews (which focus on audio quality).Overall, really impressed with this latest version.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I actually prefer the sound profile of my original Gen 1 echo though, the tall cylinder one, even though this new design has much better bass quality, maybe I have more of a vocal preference. I have mine sitting on a granite countertop in the bathroom for shower listening (volume 8 or 9) and I've noticed it moves due to strong vibrations during music playback so that's a bit annoying; room placement and hard surface surroundings may take part here.  Alexa integration and response does seem much better with this new generation with better voice pickup and quicker response (not so much yelling on my part).  I also wish the power cord it came with matched the speaker, black in my case, it came with a white one that stands out unfortunately. I really enjoy being able to connect/sync play all of my echo devices (Gen 1, Dot, and this new one) in an ""everywhere"" group throughout the house, and there's definite audio profile differences between them.

It is GREAT for aforementioned casual listening, typically with good voice recognition and response. It is NOT quite as accomplished with a stereo pairing for more focused (and higher volume) listening. The Sub really does well with rounding out the frequencies Echo can achieve in music, though it\u2019s no heavy-hitter. Then again, it\u2019s a 6\u201d woofer and not designed to be that, so that\u2019s ok. The Echos themselves do well up until about a 70-75% volume level, then start showing hints of distorting, even harshness. You can adjust the EQ settings, but even bringing down the treble does not resolve the top end being overwhelmed with upper volume.Thus, for a typical/casual music listener that\u2019s not going to push these too much, it\u2019s probably the best all-around Echo!

I've used Echos for years and it keeps getting better. This is not an audiophiles system and shouldn't be compared. It is a very adequate system for those of us who aren't anal about sound.I have two connected with the subwoofer in a 5th wheel trailer. I'm completely pleased with the sound. The bass was a bit overpowering, but I was able to adjust that with built in equalizer.It seems which ever echo microphone I'm closest to picks up commands and hasn't failed yet. I'm about 8 feet from either one and it always hears and responds well.These have the built in hub so I'm able to control lights which is cool.If you've had other echos you know what they do. I don't see how you can go wrong with them.If there is a downside its that I use a separate Dolby atmos 5.1 system for movies, TV etc. Maybe someday echos will come with rear channels?So to update this, I connected the two echo gen 4s to Firestick which was easy, however the result is not a happy ending.

However, the unit does not stay connected to the internet.  Most of the time when I ask Alexa to do something she tells me she lost connection to the internet.  I can unplug it and she's ready to go.  Come back later and it's the same issue all over again with no internet connection.  I take this device and swap locations with another Alexa device and the same issue happens.  It works for a bit and then loses internet connection while the old devices I own don't miss a beat.

Alexa then updated their app and changed it.  Got my third one, and could only sync the two on the first floor. They had to be in the same room. The two that were originally paired did stay paired. I did sync the two on the first floor  and it worked for a while. Then they got out of sync and started echoing. Drove my husband crazy two mornings. I woke up with him screaming at it. Thought he was going to have a heart attack. Had to un-sync them and use them separately. That defeated the purpose I got them for. Many times it does not understand us. I have to send in reports about this thru the Alexa app. Some times I get good answers, sometimes not. I do like having them. They are useful, and give me something to use during covid.

This review is for the 4th gen echo with premium sound. The sound really is great. I am very impressed because it isn't very big. It has punchy bass... I mean it obviously isn't a 10"" woofer, but it really is nice. It has very good sound throughout the range. I have historically had Harman Kardon and Klipsch speakers so I will use those as a reference.I would say this speaker has superior sound than any single Klipsch or Harman Kardon bookshelf speaker I have previously owned. I am not comparing it to the entire system obviously with 5 speakers and a couple subwoofers. But any single speaker, including the center channel, I would put it up against. Most people would say that isn't a fair comparison because these are wireless stand alone units. Lets just say the sound is bright and covers all ranges very fairly, especially when considering the size of the speaker.I know this isn't a fair comparison, but we replaced the echo 3rd gen dot with this and it is so far superior.

I did want to try the Echo sub.  When the Echo 4 price dropped I bought two and also bought a sub.  I mounted the 4s on small tripods (not sure if it changed the sound much).I know the Studios are bigger with bigger components and bigger sound but my space is not that large. The savings of $130 per unit pushed me over. I figured eventually if the Studios go on sale I might buy a couple and replace a couple of Dots I still use.I have every device, including two Echo shows, in a whole house group.  I love this option.Disclaimer:. I am not an audio expert and am older and starting to experience some hearing loss.  Still, the improvement is pronounced from the original Echo and the Dots (a couple different eras) and I am happy with my choice.I have not connected the new speakers and sub to my Fire TV that I actually bought with that intention.

It's pretty. Though, I don't know why if Amazon redesigned Echo units, why not offer more color choices this time around?????? Why not a red, green, eggplant purple?? I also liked the turn-dial volume control on the older unit. I think it offered more exact control and ease of use, as well as the light ring that used to be on top, as opposed to now being in the very bottom of the unit. A person could see the entire ring when it was in top, now you can only see the portion of the ring you're facing, as it rotates and disappears behind the opposite side of the unit, ....like the dark side of the moon. The Sound however, I think is an improvement. The old unit sounded great considering it's size. But this unit, although not noticebly bigger, has better bass, and wider overall sound quality. And SOUND is the whole point for me. Alexa's assistance with information and home-living is very helpful, but I purchased Echo for the ease of placing music in every room and access to just about any song I can think of.  And with that priority in mind, I think this new unit is improved.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

Sphere shape less likely to knock over.,"\nLet me start by saying that I like multifunction gadgets especially for my smart home setup. I had this item in my cart for a month before buying as I wanted to make sure that this was not an emotional purchase. I can tell you now that the wait was totally worth it as the device blew me away when I had it setup. The sound is a big step up to the echo dots I have. Deep bass and decent highs make the music come alive. You do have to find a good spot though. I would recommend placing it in a corner with the least clutter as show in the pic. Placing it on top a wooden furniture will also enhance the bass.Now to the smart home functions. The device was able to detect my smart devices fairly easily. Be sure to have your smart devices in pairing mode before trying to discover. So far there have been some hit and miss in terms of configuring my smart devices. However once they are up and running they work fine. My tip here is to give your smart bulbs etc easy to pronounce names. This will prevent alexa having to ask you which one did you mean etc.I do have one thing I disliked, a software peeve. The alexa app needs a redesign in terms of it not being very intuitive for handling devices. I have a samsung smart thing and the interface is way better in managing my smart device.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

Since I used it for audio on my PC and the volume on the PC is fixed, there is only Echo's volume I can change.

I was reluctant to buy it because I thought it was ugly, but I was happily surprised to find that it is actually quite attractive.Some quick background:  Along with this Gen 4 Echo, I own two Gen 1 Echos, two Gen 2 Echos, and two Gen 3 Echos, along with several non-Amazon Alexa-capable.The sound quality is a small, but noticeable, step forward from the previous (3rd) generation Echo.  It is not a big enough step forward that you should replace your 3rd Gen Echo, however.  What IS nice is that it has a built in thermostat (so you can ask Alexa what the inside temp is, which could be a nice feature when out of town).  Also, it has the built-in hub capability.Compared to 1st and 2nd Gen Echos, the sound and microphone quality is massively improved.  I retired a Gen 1 Echo when I bought this one, and the difference is huge.  I would recommend replacing your first or second generation Echo with this one.

But if I paid more than $60 I'd be disappointed. If you have the space a good sound bar works well and sounds great with a dot. But in small spaces where flat surfaces are at a premium, but you still want ""good"" sound, this a good choice. The sound is richer and fills the room better than just a dot. If you buy new from Amazon, using the aleza app, it practically sets itself up. Great for the Kitchen, Master Bath, Kids Bedroom or small apartment. But if your an audiophile it won't impress you as a stand alone source for music in larger living areas. Its good, and better than a dot, but not a value over the price of a good sound system. You get what pay for, think in terms of the speaker inside, given the price what do expect that priced speaker to sound like, don't expect it too sound like $400 to $800 Bose, because it doesn't cost close to that.

As for audio, this is the first ""Alexa"" device I've owned so I cannot compare it to previous models' sound quality.  The bass is okay, but I agree with others who say the treble speakers used in the device could have been better.  You won't get component stereo hi-fi sound out of the device and there's no way I've found that will boost the frequencies on the high end. It sounds more like what comes from speakers with the ""tweeters"" not working very hard and the mid-range speakers trying to make up for that fact.  I would still recommend the device for its functionality, but while possibly better sounding than the standard Alexa 4th Gen Echo, this version's ""enhanced"" sound quality will still be underwhelming to audiophiles.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

The quality of audio of this device, versus the first generation, is outstanding. What I like the most is that this Echo can still hear my wakeup word even while music is playing, something that was extremely difficult to do on the first gen Echo without having to SCREAM the wakeup word several times. Those two things are the main positive differences for me. I do not use the ultrasound motion sensor on this device, nor the Zigbee hub (because although I can connect Zigbee stuff to it, the current status of those devices is never registered/updated; totally useless). A couple cool additional features over the old device is the ability to use different voices and multilanguage. A big dislike for me is that the light ring is at the bottom. I prefer it at the top, like on the first gen device, since I was able to see it from any angle without obstructions.

At first I had it connected via Bluetooth, but after messing around in the app a bit, I discovered this awesome \u201csecret\u201d feature. My motivation was the fact that I got sick and tired of Alexa announcing that the computer was connected each and every time when the computer was awakened. There is a selection within the settings on the app that allows you to change the 3.5mm jack on the back from an output to an input. That was the coolest feature to me! There is a very slight delay in the audio startup, but it\u2019s not like the  mile-long delay when connected by way of Bluetooth. I\u2019m sure this will be sorted out after an update or two. It\u2019s not enough to upset me, though. I want to dive further into the features that are supported by the included Zigbee hub. There\u2019s nothing in the manual about that, though. Those were the two main reasons I bought it. The sound is just as good, if not better than, just about any computer speakers you can buy for the same money.I hope this was helpful.\n",7 people found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

Sound quality is great and having Zigbee built into the $99 dollar speaker (RIP Echo Plus) is great for my home light setup. The ONLY reason (and warning) that this Echo lost a star is when 2  of these Echos are paired as a home theater setup with a 4K fire stick or Cube the volume is horrendously low on streaming video. At max volume the echo was maybe 60-70% of what the Echo Plus setup was. Oddly music and any other skills volume is fine. I assume this is some weird issue in \u201csurround\u201d sound processing. Only way to make louder is to mess with EQ settings but then sound balance isn\u2019t great. I\u2019m positive a firmware update can fix this but extremely annoying that this is not equal to (or better) than the Echo Plus even though there is even one extra speaker in the new Echo. So for now I would say an absolute buy for non home theater setups and maybe a wait to buy if this is going to mainly be used in home theater mode. I\u2019ll update this review if I see any change.\n,4 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Crisp, powerful bass even at low volume.Even though I wasn\u2019t interested in the assistant features I do make frequent use of the timer, reminders, to do list  and alarms.  They all work seamlessly with my iPhone.Comparatively speaking, I was looking into getting a HomePod mini from Apple for $99.  At $30 cheaper the echo makes more sense for me because I use Spotify and Apple Homepods for some stupid reason don\u2019t support Spotify (which if we\u2019re being honest is the superior streaming platform in every quantifiable way).My only complaint about the echo is that is has to stay plugged in to work. It would have been absolutely perfect if this thing had a battery and you could move it around anywhere without having to consider where a power outlet was.  I see that there\u2019s an adapted that you can purchase to gain that functionality for $40, but I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019d want to buy that as I suspect the 5th gen might come with that.

Smart-life devices got unresponsive once but it was easily fixed. Spotify music does not always behave as expected but it works fine for the most part.- Running routines by saying a custom word does not always work. Sometimes Alexa would go to Wikipedia and read something instead of running an action.

I find the sound to be very satisfying and full ranged.  Plus you can adjust the 3-band EQ (bass, midrange, treble) to your taste in the app.  The bass quality is quite good, but when you get to a party-time level, the speakers will pop, even with the bass set to center.  But even worse is any kind of hip-hop or anything with a deep bass beat -- they will it make it pop (crackle/distort,) even at fairly low volumes.  Also I have found Alexa to misunderstand me a few times, even though I was close to the Echo and speaking very clearly.  The number ""nine"" must be pronounced long and clear or you'll get ""that was incorrect"" (if you're playing a trivia game, for example.Overall, I like the Echo a lot, and enjoy it's rich sound.

Once they connected to our Wi-Fi network, it took only a few minutes through the app to pair them to the Fire Cube to create a sound system.

This is possibly the loudest echo. Sound quality is good. Especially at the price point. The claim to be able to pair with fire TV and use as a speaker is awesome, I have not tried to do it yet. But that is something I have wanted, no need for a speaker bar. Not 360 degree sound but directional tweeters.

The mount allows the Echo to swivel so I can point it in the direction of the listener. A neat feature of the Echo that is not available in the Echo dot is a temperature sensor.

However the design change was a horrible mistake. Moving from a tall cylinder shape to a shorter cylinder shape was an excellent move. Turning that into a ball was a horrible decision. First, few things are shaped that way in your house so instead of blending, it stands out. Secondly it is significantly wider, so it takes up more room, and due to its fabric covering will end up collecting way more dust on its wider top surface area. The previous model had a hard plastic top where the buttons were and was therefore easy to dust. How do you dust fabric? I have vacuum it now? Finally, the lights are now no the bottom. As most folks sit these things on tables and desks with other items, it is FAR more difficult to see the lights than when they were mounted on the top of the cylinder. Clearly, this design was not thought through. Please please go back to the prior design.

It was good at voice recognition and provided internet radio streaming in yet another room in the house.Then, out of the blue, it stopped working. To be precise, it answered questions about weather and time, so it was connected to the internet. But when I asked it to ""play XXX [radio station ID]"" it echoed the command and nothing happened. I tried several radio stations with the same result. Strangely enough, it obeyed commands relayed to it from the smartphone Alexa app. I tried resetting it by interrupting the power. No help there.

I (we) have to repeat myself and/or yell if the music volume is too high.  I disagree with the others who say they don't like the sound.  I think (assuming you do mess with equalizer)  that you can find sound that is superior to the previous generation Amazon Speakers.  I also have a Sonos 1 and I think this speaker sounds as good as that one.  I do like the built in Zigbee Hub that allows me to control more smart devices.

It's mostly an issue when there is background noise such as the TV playing but it could use some improvement even when there is not background noise. The ONLY reason i bought this device is because an Amazon employee told me that there were improvements to the microphones in this device compared to the Echo Dot 3rd generation but I am questioning whether that is trued because I see absolutely zero improvement.Update 10.29.2020: Now that I've had this for a week or two I've determined that the microphones are actually even worse than they were on my echo dot 3rd gen. I will be returning this product and going back to using my echo dot 3rd gen.I know most people would not be buying this device for the same reason I did and would be getting it for the better speakers or the smart hub functionality but just in case there was anyone out there wondering if the microphones/voice recognition was any better on this device the answer would be no.\n,,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

I was worried about this until I tried it.  Our previous Echo lasted about 5 years.  We had to replace it after it was dropped one too many times.  After some research (and reading a lot of complaints about the voice recognition), I got this about a month ago, and I just wanted to say that the voice recognition problem is not a problem.  Further, this sounds a lot better: decent bass and brighter highs.  Other than that, it's an Echo.  Just say ""Alexa"" and you're off to the races.

The new echo sounds really good. Has a nice smooth sound to it that isnt harsh or overly bassy. Just perfect for background music at up to moderate levels. The built in thermometer is also a nice bonus. And fairly accurate.I did have some issues initially during setup, and it took a few tries and reboots to get wifi paired. Then spotify connect stopped working. I was ready to send it back, then firmware updated itself, and all seems well now. Lesson learned, i should have initiated a firmware update right off the bat.All in all its a nice upgrade from my 3rd gen dot, and the spherical design that initially put me off, seems to blend in nicely.One thing I would like to see changed: the light ring. It looks great, but as you increase volume, the light changes from right to left (clockwise), which if you are looking at the front of the echo, is the opposite of what you would expect.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

First of all, the sound is much clearer and the design is much better. Instead of the cylindrical design, the spherical one helps push sound out in all directions. The microphone disabling is a nice feature with the ring light at the bottom letting you know whether or not Alexa will pick up your voice. As for the volume, it doesn't distort as much at higher volumes but there is still some if you go towards the maximum. Regarding voice recognition, it does much better at picking up my voice when playing Jeopardy! and trying to answer questions instead of constantly asking me to answer in the form of a question like who is or what is, which keeps the game flow going much smoother. This version is definitely faster to answer questions as well with upgraded components. There's an aux in for directly connecting media devices to it that don't have Alexa compatibility via apps or if you want a better audio signal sent to the Echo device. Overall, it's a major upgrade that I like a lot.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

The Echo is good at the basics (turn lights on/off at X time) and makes a good stepping stone for beginners because once you advance to needing a true smart home hub, you will still want the Echo around to manage voice controls so it doesn't necessarily become obsolete in your home. I think this is pretty clear, but to reiterate: the hub is only zigbee compatible, not z-wave. The quality of the speaker is on par or a bit better than my Bose Sound Link Color (and is way better sounding than the Echo Dot) and easily connects with my iPhone to play music so again - good middle of the road option. The Echo seems to accomplish the smart home hub and speaker tasks very well for this price point (I purchased on sale for $70).

Really curious how much smaller the dot version is.The echo 4th gen does sound nice overall and is probably good enough for most people.Voice recognition works well.Zigbee works well enough for the limited amount of smart home devices i have.Setup was a little weird because it didn't recognize during set up the first time, but I just exited the app and restarted setup process and it worked fine the 2nd time without issues.I'd recommend this for those who are getting their first smart home device like I was, especially if it's on sale.

The bass is heavier in this unit than in previous versions which is a welcome change. The sound is crisp enough to fill a small room. It still won't replace high-end audiophile systems, but this is a step in the right direction.No longer do you need to invest in the Echo Plus to get the premium features of a Zigbee hub and built-in thermometer. These are now standard in the fourth-gen Echo.Because of the shape, Amazon has been forced to put the lighting at the bottom of the device so this may influence the decision on where to place it. The major flaw in the aesthetics is the white power cable that comes with the charcoal version of the Echo. I'm not sure if that's a fluke or if Amazon is following in the missteps of Samsung and making the colors different on purpose.

But, while it does in fact provide you with a bit deeper sound and tone quality, I am not sure that the difference between this and the small Dot devices that we had justifies the price difference.

The speakers are much better than the old Echo so we don't have to have it connected to the sound bar.  The sound is really good coming from the unit itself.We have lots of things that we control via our Echo devices - lights, roller shades, water fountain, robot vacuum, TV, etc., and as soon as I added this new Echo to the devices via the Alexa app it was seamless.

The size of the 4th Generation is about the size of a ""baseball"" the size of the 4th Generation with premium sound is the size of a ""cannonball"" so much larger.The sound quality is even more impressive than every Echo device I've ever owned to date, and I have owned every Echo Dot from 2nd Gen up.I accidentally played music on the 4th Gen w/premium sound and the concrete walls in my living room SHOOK!The bass is full and rich and the voice recognition seems to be better. My one complaint with the 4th Gen is the device either fails to respond or not responding correctly. I seem to have less issues with that with the larger 4th Gen with premium sound.Also I've had no integration issues with any of my 4th Gen devices.I'm actually considering upgrading my other two 4th Gen with the larger Echo 4th Gen device.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Audio is perfect with the option to mess in its sound settings. Voice recognition on point, can pick my voice up from across the room. Only issue was the Bluetooth. Initially when pairing with your Philips Hue bulbs it would work but once you move them, Alexa stops detecting them. I tried resetting the bulb with its code but that didn't work though the bulb flickered for a second. To fix the issue I had to reset Alexa back to set up mode and pair the light bulbs again by resetting it with its code. Another issue was that sometimes Alexa would not play the audio from my laptop though it was connected. When I try to disconnect or forget my laptop device on the Alexa app it would give me errors or won't disconnect/ forget. Just unplug Alexa and replug, head to the Alexa app and try disconnecting or forgetting the device again.

The sound quality is amazing - deep base - and some added unexpected perks with lyrics showing up on the FireTV when I stream music.  I also love using the Theater sound instead of my crappy TV speakers (old 42"" flat panel with nice picture, but poor sound).  Now my movies sound so much better!  The FireTV remote even picks up volume control now on the Echo's too.

But if I asked another Alexa device or my phone what the current temperature was in my master bedroom master bedroom it would say 75 and when I checked the Alexa app under this current device everything looks was correct. The only problem was when I asked the actual device the temperature it would say some thing super low like below freezing. On a hunch I googled what my speaker was saying assuming it was given me A measurement in Celsius and converted it to Fahrenheit and I got the correct answer. Even though everything was set correctly in the Alexa app. .so what I did to fix this. Go into Alexa app under the specific device Toggles the measurement units from Fahrenheit to Celsius then asked what the temp was gave me the same reading. Then changed it back to Fahrenheit asked again for the TEMP and that was it she is now saying the temp in Fahrenheit\n,One person found this helpful,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

Living in a neighborhood where the houses are in close proximity, being able to use headphones to listen to music is the only civil thing to do (sadly, my neighbors do have to hear me singing to the music without the benefit of the full music background).  This was one of the few Echos that have both a 'line in AND a line out' capability and with the headphones, the sound is every bit as good as listening to the original CD.

It  is also perfect to bring outside.  The voice recognition is excellent, except at very high volumes, you have to get close and scream.

The round shape is interesting, but not particularly practical on a desk/table. The mics don't seam to pick up as well as my old gen 2 echo plus. And for some odd reason the alexa voice itself is much quieter than music on the newer echo plus, which does not appear to be adjustable. Mapping my zigbee lights (hue) to the new plus has been a nightmare, though I've got it mostly working now - not sure why the configuraiton for those lights couldn't be stored and shared with the new plus. Also, don't have to echo plus devices going at the same time - will result in duplicate devices - still trying to clean that up and may ultimately have to reset the whole works. Otherwise performs as all other Alexa devices - remarkably well and does what I want with music, weather, controlling smart devices, etc.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

It even has excellent bass without having a separate bass speaker. I'm listening to the Scorpions right now and it sounds fantastic. It also sounds great with classical and folk music. We have it mounted under a kitchen cabinet using the Amazon Echo mount and wow, it sounds fantastic. It isn't as good as our Echo Studio and Echo Bass combined unit but it's a darn close second. I'm sure enough of the sound quality that I put the new Echo into my downstairs sound group along with the Studio.

We live about 20 miles apart so it bridges that gap. Theres a bit of a learning curve but she is getting the idea. She feels a little safer. She doesn't want to have to call 911 and has been known to have dizzy spells. Thankfully, the one time she fell I was in town and she had her phone on her to call me. But now, with the echo in a central location in her small house, she just has to speak from where she is and she can get ahold of me if she needs to. It has brought peace of mind to us both.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Not being a sound snob, just saying most will fine the sound quality perfectly fine, so YMMV. I like that the new design is more directional. The older designs were omni directional which doesn't make much sense unless your speaker is in the middle of a room. Most place them closer to a wall, so this has more precise, less muddy sound. A small little detail on this speaker that scores points with me is the standard speaker mounting hole. This is minor but greatly helps mounting options for me.\n",9 people found this helpful,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

The setup process was simple, plug in the unit, go into the Alexa app, and you'll see it listed in your new device list. Click on the name and choose your wireless network and you are done. Can't really ask for a better setup and user experience when you have a device that is mostly only usable through voice commands.

I'm not sure that the sound is any better, or even equal, to the previous Echo versions.  The unit certainly isn't as responsive to voice commands.  Where the other units responded quickly, with this one we have to raise our voices, get closer, and often repeat the wake command before it responds.  Altogether a mixed review as to whether this is an advancement, or a step back.  Not sure what Amazon was doing here.  Doesn't seem to have been a leap forward in any way.  Just an upsell.

Everything else is similar to the Dot it replaced and seems to work as expected.  If you're not as picky as I am about the sound, I think you will thoroughly enjoy this product.

Alexa has been very helpful with my limited mobility. I purchased this Echo, an Echo dot and Echo flex for 1800 foot 2 story townhouse. I like that I can also access Alexa from my iPhone when needed. Being able to \u201cannounce\u201d when I need help has been a lifesaver. Now it doesn\u2019t matter if my family members phones are off or in another room.

I think it's great personally and I'm picky. The bass is so rich I can literally feel it reverberate across my desk an onto my keyboard as I type this. Out of the box it was too strong, and highs too muddled. But I turned bass wayy down and treble way up (but not all the way up which I usually have to do with cheaper speakers) and now it's great. Even turned down the bass is still rich and smooth, the sign of a good woofer. The size is a bit awkward but I think that's necessary to get that woofer in there...and also I like that it's less tall that the old echo because it doesn't block a secondary monitor that I have off to the side on my desk.

But we wanted a better sound system.  After looking around we bought this base system with the two small echoes, then after a day ordered a third small echo.  SO the main echo is in one room and three small ones in other rooms.  It was well worth it for sound as well as the other features such as telling us when someone rings the doorbell etc.  I also like that I now have a Bluetooth speaker in each room that doesn't have to be recharged and can be connected by voice to my personal device for stored music in one room while others listen to different music in another room.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

Its hearing is slightly less responsive than older models - sometimes you have to repeat the wake word more often to get a response. And part of the sphere is covered so you don't appear to have a full 360 speaker. Also the madatory, new, white cord is hideous. Definitely should have left it black or at least given a choice. I can see why some would prefer white - maybe if you're mounting it against a white wall? -- otherwise black is clearly better. I'm actually tempted to paint it black. Finally, can't decide if I like the colored ring on the bottom.

Giving it 4 stars only because the mic is not very responsive, The big Echo is designed to be in large rooms like living rooms etc. i use it in a small bedroom and it still dosent pickup my voice. so if its struggling to hear me in a small room, i dont know how it will hear the command in a big room.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Not sure if they did something different with the microphone array or not, but I quite often find myself asking a question and having an Echo from the other room respond, so it seems the microphones are not as sensitive.

It is a relatively small device for such great sound. I own an old school stereo system with speakers that contain twin active 12 inch woofers, a 5 inch midrange and a super dome tweeter in each speaker cabinet, so I know good sound.  This Echo has clear lows and bright highs. When I want to listen to my favorite music, talk radio or my favorites list, I simply request it! This device has many more untapped features. My son recently purchased  an Echo. He has his turning on lights, his radio and providing audio security for his apartment and more. This product is like having a personal assistant.

Its sphere design allows it to project sounds to fill a room more effectively. I have a small TV in my kitchen. I paired it with the new Echo and a Fire TV stick. Echo makes it sounds like a much bigger entertainment system.One thing I do hope Amazon can address is to design an Echo in a soundbar format such that I can put it in front of my TV without blocking the view.

Almost all topics or questions put to it are answered, and the requests for various types of music and the speed that Alexa locates them with is unreal. I was amazed at the sound quality of music when I have the volume up loud...no breaking up of any kind and sounds like an expensive sound system. The only small drawback I have with the sound is the lack of better highs (treble) as my hearing is not so good with that and there is no tone control to adjust for that. Still have to discover more of the many uses for Alexa of which there are lots from what I read, so  it should be enjoyable. Great product!\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Combining it with the Echo Subwoofer makes for a pretty good sound.  Since my 1st Gen Echo did not support the Sub, upgrading was worth the cost.  One problem I have encountered is that the ring light on the new device is at the bottom of the sphere making it difficult to see from some parts of the room.  All and all, I am pleased with the upgrade but had I not added the sub, I would have concluded that the sound was just ok, not much better then my Gen 1 Echo.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

Voice recognition and acuity are both outstanding: all it takes is a bit more than a whisper to get Alexa's attention.Sound is very listenable, though a bit bass heavy. The unit tends to throb unless it is put on an extremely rigid surface. But that's just a quibble, as is the unit's tendency to show dust. A lighter gray would have been preferable to the almost black fabric covering.I think I paid $129 or so for my first gen unit. At $100, I consider this an excellent price/performer.

Alexa reacts to and acts on the BS commercials that promote anything that has alexa integration. WTF ALEXA?!!!!!. What is the point of voice recognition if it is going to act on anything happening on TV. My Echo is starting to get on my nerves....\n,,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

Lately alexa got slower and slower and many times did not recognize my voice commands.  I upgraded my internet provider but it had little effect on alexa.  I decided to purchase a new 3rd gen model.  What a difference.  Voice recognition is by far superior now than my original one.  I can ask alexa to add something to my shopping list from rooms away and she hears what I said and responds immediately. I am totally pleased with my purchase.\n,,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Either way I am totally impressed with everything this small ""concert hall"" can offer. Thank you Amazon, your Echo dot (4th) generation is simply amazing\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

The sound is amazing. Alexa isn't having a problem hearing us. The echo is located in the center of a large room at the end of a bar. Nothing around it. It detects  and responds to voices from every area of the open concept room.Our old first generation is great and in the bedroom now. Adding guard is a great new feature.
