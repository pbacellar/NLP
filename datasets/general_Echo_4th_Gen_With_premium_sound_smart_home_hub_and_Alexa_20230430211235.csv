Echo_4th_Gen_With_premium_sound_smart_home_hub_and_Alexa,61.76,,,SubieNewbie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on April 6, 2021",HONEST REVIEW/COMPARISON FOR ALL INTELLIGENT LIFE FORMS.,"\nThis is an honest review and comparison of the new 4th Generation Echo (not Dot) vs. the 2nd Generation Echo Plus (the last Echo Plus that was launched with the 3td Generation Echo).I actually purchased two 4th Gen Echoes to create a Home Theater Group with the FireTV Stick 4k latest variant. I'll include notes about that as well.Sound Quality Pros: I really enjoy music from different genres and I like to tinker with equalizer settings so that I get the fullest sound out of even a cheap speaker. I also like when a speaker(s) can pull double duty as a surround sound system for my television as well. That's what attracted me to the new Echoes.Regarding music streaming from Amazon Music HD, I must say the sound is really smooth and crisp. I adjusted the equalizer settings for the individual devices in the Alexa app to boost the mid most, followed closely by the treble and a moderate bass setting (if they are paired in a stereo pair or Home Theater, adjusting one device automatically adjusts the other). I have my Echoes placed about 12 feet away in front of  my primary seating spot on the sofa and the are spaced about 8 feet apart flanking the television. They are situated about 4 feet off the ground on book shelves.  This positioning has been perfect for the accoustics in my 15x18 living room with tall ceilings. The speakers really fill up the space. And I am most impressed with how the sound bounces off of the walls and truly feel as if it surrounds me and immerses my eardrums into it.This holds even more true for when I watch a movie with the Dolby Atmos setting on. I can hear the channels fairly well and it really seems like I own my own private movie theater in my living room. There's been times that there's a sound affect so specific to one channel and reproduced so clearly that I've actually muted the show thinking that I was hearing some noise from outside or in the hallway of my apartment building.These two devices together get pretty loud without any noticeable distortion. Now I haven't played much bass heavy music but I do love action and sci-fi movies that are sound effect laden and peppered with bass booming explosions etc. The new 4th Gen Echoes keep up very nicely.In contrast, though I thought I really loved the Echo Plus 2nd Gen, I now find that I really can't enjoy music or movies as much on it. I think that this is because the main speaker fires downward and the rest of the sound is omni directional. This sounds good on paper but in practice, at least for my uses, that type of speaker just seems muffled and really a waste of sound waves. Let me explain. How often to you place the Echo device in the center of a room to benefit from an omni-directional speaker? Most people don't have floor outlets under their coffee tables so it sits on an end table or bookshelf. It's usual home in a bedroom is on the end table. Even in a kitchen, unless placed on the island, the Echo rests with it's back to a wall. So, why then, would you want (let's say) 40% of the sound waves to be directed to a big slab with no ears to appreciate it?The directional sound setup of the new Echo 4th Gen is ideal, really, for it's positioning in most homes. Sound is really diminished if you are behind it or immediately to it's side but comes barrelling at your ear drums when you are any angle in front of it. It's louder, more clear, and much more advanced when it comes to being able to utilize Dolby Atmos playback. I definitely choose the 4th gen over the 2nd Gen Plus any day. I almost feel bad for unloading the Plus onto my parents when I bought the 4th Gen. I'll upgrade them this Christmas. Lol.The omni-directional speaker would be a benefit if it were placed in the center of a patio for a gathering or party, but again, where's your outlets? Not in the middle of the concrete or deck floor. So chances are, even on the patio, it will be placed backing up to an exterior wall. So the myth of the omni-directional speaker advantage is busted in my book.Voice Recognition:At first, I felt there was a noticeable difference with the Plus having the upper hand when I comes to summoning Alexa. However, I believe there have been some fairly large software updates recently that included fine tuning adjustments to the mics on the 4th Gen devices. They now clearly pick up my questions or commands from across the room and quickly cancel out the other Echo Dot I have on the far side open floor plan nearest the kitchen. Before, with the Plus, it was a toss up as to which one would respond because I firmly believe the best mics are still on the Echo Dot 3rd Gen with clock variant. Hands down. If only the echo show 5 in my bedroom would be even half as good, I'd be happy ( that unit is by far the worst with just 2 lack luster mics vs the 4 on the Dot and Plus).Alexa is also quicker to respond on the 4th Gen too. Now that's a combination of the 450-ish gbps internet speed I am fortunate enough to have but I understand it's also due to a better processor and improved software.And let me just say one thing... I don't know anyone who buys their smart home devices with  Zigbee compatibility being the #1 consideration.  Who cares? I have bought the best reviewed for the price smart bulbs, TV, and plugs etc not giving a thought to Zigbee because the latest generation smart devices don't require a hub.All of my smart home devices work just fine by enabling the skill on the Alexa app with that of the manufacturer's chosen app and linking the accounts. The biggest issue I have is trying to remember what I named each lamp and group to turn on and off the lights. First world problems, I know.For what it's worth, the big 3 smart home apps which seems to be used by these el cheapo devices are Kasa, Govee, and Smart Life. I have devices on all three and the Alexa integration is seemless. Except the darn ceiling fan speed control. Still haven't completely figured that one out entirely.Setting up the devices and Grouping:Both the Echo Plus and 4th Gens are very easy to set up initially. The Alexa app, though not entirely user friendly regarding the UI, does all the work and guides you through the process fairly quickly. The oddball thing that's a bit more challenging is knowing what the difference is between a stereo pair, a home theater and a speaker group.First, a stereo pair must be two identical models (I believe an Echo Sub woofer can be added as the one off) and the pairing is only for music streaming. Only one Echo will respond at a time when you are conversationally interacting with Alexa.In a Home Theater grouping, one or more Echo devices of the same model can be joined with a FireTV device such as the Stick 4k. A sub can also be added. The crummy part at first, is that you can't include your existing sound bar into this Home Theater Group. Amazon devices only, folks. So you must choose which you want to listen to.Now, I'm not horribly disappointed because the sound quality of the two 4th Gens on each side of the TV is really great so the sound bar isn't needed but I hate the thought of the wasted money sitting 32 inches wide in front of me producing no sound at all.IF, you have a smart TV like a Vizio, there is a way to activate the sound bar and have the Amazon Home Theater working at the same time. And here it is: the sound bar must be hooked up to an optical cable and the audio setting on the TV must be set to PCM not automatic. Auto defaults to whatever device you are streaming on ie a FireTV Stick. Then, while playing your FireTV Stick, choose the Home Theater as your audio source on the Fire TV menu. So in essence, the TV thinks it must send sound to the sound bar only while the Stick thinks it should be using the Home Theater. Through whatever glitch, I now have all three speakers working in tandem. BUT ONLY while using the FireTV device. It does not work if I am using the smart TV streaming apps from the Vizio home screen. Which I don't do anymore except for a couple things that are not found on the Amazon App store.FYI, I don't believe that the Fire Edition Insignia and Toshiba televisions sold here and at Best Buy  have the capability to set up the Home Theater function with the Alexa app.Finally, a speaker group is the best way to get unlike models to sync with each other to play music. However, there's a catch... You must ask for that group's every time at the end of your request to play music etc.Meaning, with the stereo pair and home theater, music and movies are automatically played through those selected speakers by means of the Alexa app. You would simply make the standard request for Alexa to play a song or album with no extra added specification. But remember, you're limited to only pairing the same models together for this to work like that.Now, with a speaker group, you can include your Echoes, Dots, Shows, Spots, Inputs, FireTVs, Tablets etc etc into that group and have them all going at the same time through out your home, so long as you name this all-Echo inclusive group something like ""Every where"" or ""all speakers"" or ""whole house"". Be creative :) ""Echo Symphonic Orchestra"", ""Live from the Love Shack"", or ""on all decks of the Enterprise"" (you can even call your individual room groupings for lights and sounds things like "" the Bridge"" -Living Room, ""Ship's Galley"" -Kitchen, ""Ten Forward"" - dining or rec room, ""Shuttle Bay Two""-garage, "" Engineering""-utility room/basement, and ""Captain's Quarters""-master bedroom, ""Risa"" -backyard patio). Lol. Alexa groups can be named whatever you want! I digress though....The point is you have to tell Alexa to play music AND include the name of the speaker group everytime or else music will just play from the device you speak into. Ex: ""Alexa play the song Starships on all decks of the Enterprise"" or (boring) ""Alexa, play Mr. Robot-o, everywhere"" or ""Play a lullaby in the dirty diaper factory (nursry)"". Get it?! I can sense your mind is starting to ignite like a solid rocket booster, now.I really hope this helps someone. I know it's been a learning curve for me. And not always a lot of fun. Just wait til you first start exploring how to build your own custom routines or then decide to relocate devices into different rooms as you upgrade with new ones. It can be a labor of love...or regret.Bottom line, if you  are looking to upgrade but aren't entirely sure, try out the new Echo 4th Gen (especially in a pair for a Home Theater) and decide within 30 days if you really like them. Definitely explore the Alexa app and routines. And commit to replacing at least one bulb in each room with a color changing LED smart bulb to experience the fun you can have with this device. Also, I think you will be pleasantly surprised at what many people say is a drawback about being a directional speaker is really a benefit for most user's needs, including yours.Some people will find fault in anything and some will find that they can't have everything to their exact liking. There's not a perfect smart speaker out there, so figure out what you must have features are, your nice to haves, and your deal breakers are and make the choice.Regardless, enjoy these little glimpses of the future. Heck, they're even spherical shaped just like what the future devices and ships looked like in 2001: A Space Odyssey and Space Balls or a Borg scout ship, even. You gotta think that's at least a nice nod for sci-fi fans everywhere. Or if you are a devotee of mod design or simply a believer in form following function, then this ball of joy is sure to please. So, enjoy your new Echo; It's outta this world!-Picard, out. Hailing frequencies closed.\n",545 people found this helpful,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo
Echo_4th_Gen_With_premium_sound_smart_home_hub_and_Alexa,61.76,,,Arthur,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on March 17, 2023","Easy setup, great for what it is.","\nWell, I have to say I love that its a speaker that has Alexa on it. If I had to complain though it would be easy truthfully. The music function. I had the advertised Unlimited plus music feature, after it was advertised as the only way for my grandmother to play certain old songs she was looking for with ease instead of her asking and then getting a different song with an advertisement worked in. However, it worked out for 2 seconds because I thought, why not pay more and get an Amazon Echo dot too for her room ao she could listen through the house. So that apparently added almost 20 bucks a month to a free service we had before. Mind you, I already pay for Prime and I added the Music Unlimited. But because she wanted to play her music softly in her room for ambience and then play it differently in the livingroom, Amazon said she had to upgrade to another more expensive music package called Unlimited Family. Thats the only way to she can listen to music she wants on her devices throughout her home. Again, the service costs more than most video services and is more than spotify, xm radio, or well just about any radio service that allows the option to pick a song via voice recognition these days. They really like to nickel and dime you for the most basic things and it isnt riggt in my opinion. If you pay to have music options through Amazons library, why should you pay more and more for ease of getting to that music? I mean, Amazon music uses to have all the music I could ever look for free with my Amazon Prime membership. And I think they added the voice search feature before this fee on top of a fee thing happened. It is crazy to me that every time you want to actually use the products that come out to the desirable extent they are advertised, you get either microtransactions blown at you, or even worse now you get a hefty monthly additional bill. Again, after being a member with the company paying a monthly fee for over a decade. Why would they think this would keep customer loyalty? All it does is make customers hope for and await another option that has something similar or even a little less nice for a better price. Can you imagine if a competitor like Ebay or Facebook got together and created a decent music library access via buying something like soundcloud or spotify. It has to be easy for the CEOs to themeselves want another option on a platform built similar to the Echo. And people themselves in the public that for the middle class have to like me be eager to seek out that second option. Yes the supply chain and easy shipping options makes it the onlyntrue source to buy things quickly and easily and Prime is still a great deal for that reason. But the echo, the dot, etc... are all just waiting to be taken off the shelves at this rate. And it is awful, because the advertised version and or even the versions where you can use the full functionality after burning a million dollars on unlocking them each month proves the Echo and its component products can do and be great products that make amazon something worth keeping a membership with for years to come. However, selling a product to active prime members and then putting limiters all over the software with the intent to create more monthly revenue on a loyal cusyomer base that you could of just succeeded in making that much more reliant on keeping a membership. Thats jist greedy and dumb at the same time. The echo or other products of this line have zero need to have these extra upcharges is the point. Get rid of them before your customers get rid of the products tge moment a better option becomes viable. Yes we will keep prime for the shipping. But heck, prime video is just rediculous right now with advertisements, fees for decent shows and movies and then just nothing of real value for prime members. It used to be a great service with limited options. But we loved and used it all the same because it was free for Prime members. Same with Amazon music. I loved it and used it all the time. No its advertisements for every song or monthly fees. So tired of the fee onslaught that comes with buying anything that looks like its useful these days. Thats the summary here. Amazon, you dont need to do what your doing. Your products have the ability to be in every household and used regularly everywhere. You will make a killing just selling the next updated color of the echo. Imstead of closing up video and music access. Eat the costs on rights and give it to your prime customers. You already raised rates for that too. But your cutting services on top of raising rates. What are you thinking. Your monopoly isnt unbeatable. Its difficult to see past the day people choose something better knowing what your chains look like right now. But Im telling you, this way of pushing customers for everything you want just because you can at the moment will end up making you the myspace of well....you know. Thats just my and millions of other peoples opinion though right now. So take it for what its worth.\n",11 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo
Echo_4th_Gen_With_premium_sound_smart_home_hub_and_Alexa,61.76,,,C,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on December 15, 2020","New Shape, New Processor, Better Sound","\nThe new Echo 4th Gen is a big change in aesthetics and design for the Echo line.  The new spherical shape is wider and shorter than previous Echo versions, and now focus sound in one primary direction instead of 360 degrees.  It adds an extra tweeter, and seems to produce more sound than previous versions.  Here are my early thoughts so far, after using it for about 24 hours:THE GOOD:Setup was incredibly simple.  I just powered the device on, and the Echo announced that it was ready for setup.  I opened the Alexa app on my phone, and the new Echo was automatically detected and set up instantly.  I didn't have to enter any information at all.  It can't get any easier than this.BETTER SOUND.  This new Echo has an extra tweeter, for a total of two 0.8 inch tweeters, and the same 3.0 inch Sub from the Gen 3 Echo.  This new Echo is designed with the tweeters pointed forward, and the speaker placement seems to generate more bass also somehow, even with the same Sub as the Gen 3.  All in all I think it sounds much better than Gen 3, with a little more bass and louder max volume.  This could also be do to the sound-mapping feature that allows Echo to maximize the sound by detecting the acoustics and shape of the room.  You can also pair two of these in stereo; and you are supposed to be able to use it as a speaker for your FireTV device, though I haven't tested that out yet.Temperature sensor included.  Yes, you can ask Alexa what the temperature is, and it seems very accurate so far.  This is a nice touch, and I look forward to doing more testing, to see if I can set up routines based on temperature.AZ1 Processor. This new Amazon processor promises better voice recognition and faster Alexa responses.  In my testing so far, I have barely noticed a slight speed improvement (for example turning on certain room lights) but there are supposed to be upcoming updates that will make an even bigger difference in speed.Zigbee + Sidewalk Bridge.  This comes with a Zigbee hub, just like previous versions of the Echo Plus.  It also contains the new Sidewalk Bridge, which allows the Echo to use bluetooth and radio connections to connect to some smart devices at long range, and push data to the internet.THE BAD:No 360 degree speakers.  While I personally prefer the sound of this new version, some people might miss the 360 degree speaker setup of previous Echo generations.  It certainly might lead to a situation where the ideal placement of the Echo in your room could be different.White power cord.  This is minor, but a strange choice.  No matter what color Echo you get, the power cord is white.  Some people might find that annoying.Voice detection is not great while loud music is playing.  This surprised me, as previous generations haven;t really struggled with this in my experience.  I'm not sure if it is because this speaker is much louder, but Alexa hasn't heard me a few times when I talked while the music was playing at max volume.  This could be annoying if you often listen to very loud music.NEUTRAL: -Aesthetics.  I think I preferred the look of the cylinder design, instead of this new sphere shape.  This is totally personal preference of course.  I also wish the entire sphere was fabric, instead of being plastic on the back side.  Some people might prefer the ball shape though, so that is up to you.All in all, I'm keeping this new Echo because of the better sound and faster responsiveness, but it is not really a massive upgrade.  Pretty decent so far, I'll update this review and try to answer any questions in the future!\n","2,586 people found this helpful",Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo
Echo_4th_Gen_With_premium_sound_smart_home_hub_and_Alexa,61.76,,,Jeff S,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on November 22, 2022",These are like echo dots on steroids!! Twice as big but sound 5 times Better!!!,"\nI have my apartment which is not a small apartment and it has a loft as well for my 12-year-old son so he has his own area he\u2019s getting to that age so anyway I had I think 5 echo dots and one echo show that had the visual screen for pictures and things like that but without a subwoofer or anything I was fine with the multi room music and I used it for that and basically also used it so I could just tell any of my echo dots or just basically when I open the door I would say Alexa Turn on my apartment!! Immediately all of my lights would come on and some of them are dimmed to a certain level which you can do in the settings on your Alexa app that most people have on their phones. I even have a couple lightbulbs that are multicolored so I have them set to green and red currently for Christmas!! So the lights all come on when I tell Alexa to do that including my living room TV as well. You can add numerous other items that are compatible with Alexa and/or SmartThings app and you name it. If you don\u2019t have something that is compatible or doesn\u2019t have Bluetooth or wifi etc\u2026 as long as you use a plugin for that item you can at MINIMUM turn it off and on with your voice or touch screen on your phone or Alexa show and I bought 2 of these Echoes because my friends have one or more and it is a sphere. So even though it\u2019s twice as big as the echo dot, in the newer generations at least, they started out looking like a hockey puck which is still good and people have them still but I started using Alexa products just a couple years ago so, mine are all round balls that you can talk to and play music and control lights and cameras for security while home or check on your home while you\u2019re not there!!I bought 2 regular Echoes to replace 2 of the echo dots because they have 3 or 4 different speakers in each one!!! Crazy how much sound you get from the dot but the bigger one the regular echo, sounds like a huge floor speaker but it\u2019s just a ball and you can get black or white or blue and more so I got 2 of them to pair together for stereo sound and to my Samsung TV that has an Alexa app built into it. So I can rock out or get surround sound when paired with my TV and Soundbar Sub woofer which I don\u2019t use the soundbar anymore the echoes sounded better but I got them last month. They were 49.99 a piece!!! That\u2019s like half price and why I hadn\u2019t bought them before so for 100 bucks I have a completely wonderful set of speakers that you barely notice and they sound wonderful and you can buy them with a Studio speaker by Amazon or an Amazon Subwoofer bundled for even more awesome sound but I live in an apartment so I don\u2019t want to get kicked out!!! They act as a hub for all of your Amazon devices also so you don\u2019t need anything else but one echo honestly to run all of your lights just get the type of bulbs they suggest and they have bundles for those also and it\u2019s truly amazing what quality of sound and other things that they can do but I have already typed far toooooo much. Start with 1 even for listening to music over the holidays and add devices as you go. That\u2019s what I did and 2 years later I have it set up so we\u2019ll that I can talk to my son when he\u2019s at his Moms house on his echo and my echo here and there\u2019s no need for buying him a cellphone!! Yet!!There\u2019s just so much I could say about what these things do for 50 bucks to get one of them is a steal because you\u2019re just keep adding things and finding different things like grocery list reminders and alarms. It helps you with many things you wouldn\u2019t even imagine.So now, when I open my door to my apartment, I have it set to where the lights automatically come on with my TV. I don\u2019t even have to talk. It\u2019ll do that too so kudos to the designers of these things because they are very affordable and do so much.!!!\n",60 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo
Echo_4th_Gen_With_premium_sound_smart_home_hub_and_Alexa,61.76,,,Albert A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on March 17, 2023","Alex, turn up the music!","\nThe Amazon Echo (4th Generation) speaker has a sleek spherical design that is available in three colors: charcoal, glacier white, and twilight blue. It offers great audio quality for its price compared to premium speakers from other known brand, with one 3-inch woofer and two 0.8-inch tweeters that deliver strong bass and clear highs. The Echo has great smart home skills that can take control of compatible devices without the need of a separate hub. One of the neat features of this speaker is that it includes support for Amazon Sidewalk which can extend the range of your smart devices. The Echo also has and 3.5mm audio input/output that can be connected to external speakers or headphones as well as receive audio from other devices. Aside from controlling your devices, the Echo includes Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice assistant that can answer questions, play music, set timers, control smart devices, and so much more.When it comes to my experience with the Echo, I can\u2019t praise it enough. The initial setup is a breeze. There is only a power cable to plug into the device and to an electrical outlet. The Amazon Alexa app does a great job in walking you through the steps to get you up and running. For the most part, the speaker works great. In some occasions, the speaker doesn\u2019t wake up properly when using the wake word, in my case \u201cAlexa.\u201d I\u2019ve noticed that after several days I would have to unplug the device to force reboot it whenever it would happen. However, when Alexa does wake, she can sometimes have trouble hearing me even though she's placed well in the center of my bedroom. When it comes to audio quality, I\u2019m very impressed. The Echo easily became the go to speaker to listen to when I listen to music at home. For the current price, it\u2019s a great purchase and easy recommendation and even better when it gets marked down on sale. Can\u2019t wait to see what the 5th Gen brings to the table.\n",2 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

And I didn't think I was going to wind up using it very much but being visually impaired I wound up using it a lot more than I expected.I came to find out that I could listen to my audible books and also my kindle books read to me which is great for my visual impairment it makes it a lot more enjoyable during the day when I become bored with trying to figure out what is actually on the television with my provision some things are just not watchable like they used to be.But the echo. 2nd Gen. Speakers are well they leave a lot to be desired and I had to add additional speakers so when I saw this item I was like I'm gonna go see what the reviews are like and everyone said they were awesome they're awesome and so much better than the. 2nd Gen. So I decided to go ahead and get one for my birthday as a gift to myself and additionally I got the battery and the silicone carry case combination to go with it and I can take the thing all over my house in my yard and that is so cool.Since I've gotten this particular one though I have found there are so many other things that I can do with it other than just listen to my audio books and kindle books I can listen to podcasts I can get the daily news I can check the temperature in the room that the echo is in it is in which is really cool because I don't have an interior thermostat in my house I run on a space here and a wood stove so I never know what the interior temperature of my house is but I do now.There are also cool games you can play play I've been playing prices right and Trivia and a choose your own adventure kind of game andAre you smarter than a 5th grader by the way I'm smarter than a 5th grader.I opted in for Amazon music and not only am I finding all the songs that I've forgotten from my past but I found some really cool new ones things things that I would have never found without this echo.I've created playlists that when I'm in the mood for one thing or another I just tell she who cannot be named what playlist I want to hear and all of a sudden there I am.She can also actuate my televisionI have a roku TV but I have also added a fireStick as well and she can actuate both of them and also my easy buzz camera that I have to keep an eye on my front porch and yard and be able to speak to people out there when I have guests without going to the door.Being visually impaired this thing is a real helping hand the only thing would be better is if she could clean my house maybe Amazon will get there eventually.But for now I'm very fond of this deviceOther cool additional thingsI like how much bass the speaker has I like to listen to binaural beats music and meditation music and some dance music for exercise and I can feel the music it's pretty cool.The speaker is pretty darn decent.I chose the white version because because white is a color that I can see better with my vision the only concern I have is that the speaker cover might eventually get dirty but they get dirty I try to dust it on a daily basis just to make sure.We also are using it for well-to-do list for one, alarms, oh and I've set a household network up where the smaller echo. that I was gifted is now in my kitchen and I can play them as a group oop or someone in my kitchen can drop in on me and ask me if I want dinner or if I'm busy and vice versa I can drop in on them as well well additionally I've set it up so I can tell it to make phone calls directly from my cell phone and works as a great speaker phone I've tested it out a few times and everybody says that they can hear me just fine and clear.By the way for a little fun ask her to Beam me up Scottie.

Echo_4th_Gen_With_premium_sound_smart_home_hub_and_Alexa,61.76,,,Don B,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on January 7, 2023",DON'T buy a used one!,"\nI bought 2 of these as refurbished, to add to the other 3 that I have in the downstairs of my home. One would not connect after repeated attempts.  Not the end of the world, just inconvenient and a hassle. Especially after working all day, this should be about a 15 minute procedure for BOTH units. So, after 45 minutes on ONE, I stopped attempting the connection, and switched to the other unit.  The other unit connects within minutes (as it should) and I went back to the other one. This is the 5th time now to attempt a connection, and it won't take. So, I click on the Alexa app for an Amazon rep with technical support to call me. So, a guy calls, and wants me to walk through the connection process with him on the phone. I get it, they need to verify the issue, so I oblige him and go through it with him on the line.Well, attempt number 6 fails with him on the phone, and let him know that was as far as I could get prior to asking for tech support. He wants me to unplug it, and start it back up again. I said OK, but this will be the 6th time of doing that exact thing. So I unplug it, and it reboots itself (as before), and we walk through the setup process again, and guess what?  Will NOT connect. I asked since this was refurbished, if it was possible, by any chance, that it is still connected to the previous owner?  He said he already checked on that, and it was not. So, now he wants me to unplug it once again, and close the Alexa app. I did both already, and informed him of such, but he insists that we need to do so.  OK, we'll try it again. So unplug, close the app completely, plug back back in, power up, and reopen app. Go through set up process, will not connect again.  Frustration is starting to creep up on me, and he says hang on, I am going to reset your system remotely.  Ok, maybe that helps (perhaps he should have suggested that early on?), I don't know. Either way, phone is silent for a minute or so, then the hold music starts to play for another minute or 2 (maybe 3, not even sure now) and then I am disconnected!  Wow, really? Ok, I am sure that was an error on his part, not intentional, but still....So, I call back, get bounced to the right department, tell the story to another tech support guy, he agrees that it is faulty and says he can just refund my purchase. Well, I let him know that I don't want a refund, I want a replacement item. That is why I bought 2 more to begin with.  No luck, refund only, so I agree to it.Well the other that is connected up, once I played some music on it, the speaker was obviously worn out, and distorted.So now, I am returning both of them.Probably going to go with 2 new ones at this point.\n",10 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I\u2019m living in the future and that Future is here NOW!,"\nI have 8 Echos in various rooms and from several generations. Yep, I have a big house... What attracted me to this generation was that onboard voice capabilities that makes response faster and sure, who doesn\u2019t want even better sound quality? I also liked the design better than the looks of the previous generations and that I could see the activity \u2018light ring\u2019 when I was sitting down. The spherical designed has some real advantages and it\u2019s apparent in the improved sound. And improved it is. Music is easily better, more complex and effortless. This is NOT supposed to be a blast the neighborhood out speaker, but it did fill a larger room with quality sounding music that is noticeably improved to past generations. Voice commands and responses are practically instant and tigger happy quickly improved... Me likes so much that I replaced 2 of my 8 for in the areas where I am most using them. I even returned my first gen to amazon to get 25$ off then new one. Understand, my old ones are in pristine condition with all the original packaging and boxes, but how great to be able to do this!My whole house is voice controlled, lighting, fireplaces (ceramic logs with LED \u2018fake fire lights\u2019), thermostat and as an early adopter of the Echo Voice Assistant, I\u2019ve never looked back. Being able to ask any question, to ask about a stores hours before even driving there to make sure it\u2019s open and then being given the option to phone DIRECTLY from the device, is sweet. And how about NEVER having to touch your alarm clock to hit snooze or turn it off again? Yes please. Get quick and accurate local weather reports instantly, air quality too! Need to be reminded, multiple timers or announcements and intercom functions. Just say the word. I have every news channel I want set in my flash briefing and LOVE these, hearing them most days. Here\u2019s my line up:  Daily scripture, this day in history, Fox news, BBC news, Management tip of the day and a few more. You can easily add what YOU want to hear and it\u2019s a treat. I LOVE podcasts and there\u2019s a series called \u201cHardcore History\u201d with hundred of episodes. Some of which are 6 hours long! What\u2019s cool is I can start one of these while I\u2019m cooking in the kitchen, tell the device to stop when I\u2019m finished and when I later (day, month, weeks or whatever) tell it to \u201cPlay Hardcore History\u201d it will name the episode I left off on and pick it up for exactly the same spot! How sweet that??And guys, knock yourselves out because there are thousands of podcasts on virtually any subjects to enjoy and learn from. I love having this ability!!! LOVE, Love, love the ability to always be learning new things from this device while still doing what I do do in the background. There\u2019s so much more and I could literally go on for hours with what a great enhancement this has been in so many ways, learning, security, information, entertainment, news, communications, etc. Being able to have my arms full, walk though my house and just TEll a light to turn on along the way without having to touch or find a switch is sublime!  Yep, you need the right lights, but boy, talk about convenience and living in the future now. NEVER going back!  Even my landscaping lights and sprinkler control system, my security cameras works with it. And if I want to make an announcement to the whole house, I just say, \u201cEcho, repeat EVERYWHERE\u201d and then tell it what I want to say. And all 8, in every room will go off: \u201cDinner is in 5 minutes!\u201d So sweet!I also have 2 of the Echo Clocks that work with the device and they are awesome. The LED ring and countdown before the alarm going off is sweet.But guys, I even LOVE just telling the Echo to play rain/storm sound effects and it\u2019s calming, deep and healing. What a wonderful, effortless device with so many capabilities. Even during one of my personal bible studies, I can ask Echo for some background on virtually anyone I reading about and background is forthcoming.Yes, I was an early adopter and man, these are a purchase I\u2019ve never regretted making. I use them EVERY day and they have enhanced my life in ways that are special, rich and convenient. Like something out of a Dick Tracy comic from the 1930\u2019s, this system is here, ripe, mature and developed. I\u2019m such a fan!The only suggestion I have for Amazon would be to give me the option in a metal package. Who wants to dust fabric? Lastly, IF you built in even great Biblical knowledge capability, you\u2019d sell even millions more. Give me a teaching assistant that has a data base to field just about anything biblical I could ask of it.LOVING this product and the direction it\u2019s going. The future IS now and ECHO is the best, most supported, device with thousands and thousands of functions. Thank you Amazon and keep enhancing this baby because I\u2019m upgrading all along the way. I returned on for a discount and the other 1st gen is going to a charity raffle.

The echo 4th gen is definitely the best of all of these. I have even owned the bose portable, some really expensive Sony speakers. For the size and sound quality and reliable and fast voice recognition, these can't be beat.Issues with the homepods:The homepod had great sound quality, but it was big and you still dont get the stereo separation effect you can get with two speakers one on each side of the room, and after a firmware update the speaker developed a weird and terrible sounding issue and I had to throw it away. Apple discontinued it so I couldn't buy a replacement. The homepod minis used to be good, in fact better sound quality than probably the echo dot 5th gen (I didn't test it personally, just heard the sound in a review). However they started becoming unreliable as well, one would cut out midsong or there would be a weird echoing effect and the voice recognition was always slower than an echo device. And sometimes siri wouldn't recognize at all, or she would say 'something went wrong, this is taking longer than I expected'.... a lot.So switching over to two Echo 4th gens, in a stereo pair, was really great because the voice recognition is faster and she usually understands what I say and play it. I could say the same request to both and Siri wouldn't get it while Alexa would.However there was a major issue, at first they wouldn't pair in a sound pair. I had to web search and find out that what you have to do is plug in one speaker only, say 'alexa check for updates' and then wait until that speaker updates, then unplug it, do that for the second speaker, unplug it when done, then update the alexa app on your phone, then plug everything back in and try to pair them again in the app. That worked for me. Amazon really dropped the ball on this, and I had to remove a star, you shouldn't get a product that has a basic feature like the speakers working in a stereo pair that requires a bunch of googling to solve. I can imagine the frustration if you buy two and then they don't work in a stereo pair and your googling skills aren't good enough. Another knock on Alexa compared to Siri in general, is that lately Alexa has been spamming me asking me if I want stuff. Siri never does that. Alexa will say things like 'by the way (advertisement, would you like to try it/buy it?) However as far as I know there is no reliable Apple smart speaker that exists so this is your best option. Note that I didnt try the google products because I gave up on google made products, they all seem to break (chromebook, pixel 6, google wifi, etc. and then google always makes some excuse why they wont fix it- so not only do their products break but they also won't fix them- I gave up on them)\n",6 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

While this device is an excellent addition to any home, one downside is that it has a limit on the number of speakers that can be added to create a home theater setup.Unfortunately, the Alexa app only allows you to add up to two speakers to your home theater system when using the Echo (4th Gen) as the hub. This limitation can be frustrating for those who want to create a more immersive audio experience, as it prevents them from adding additional speakers to enhance the sound quality of their home theater setup.It's important to note that this limitation is not unique to the Echo (4th Gen) and is a limitation of the Alexa app in general. However, it's still disappointing for those who were hoping to create a more robust home theater setup with the Echo (4th Gen) as the hub.Despite this limitation, the Echo (4th Gen) is still a great device that offers excellent sound quality and a variety of useful features. Its smart home hub capabilities make it easy to control various devices in your home, and its built-in Alexa functionality provides a hands-free way to access music, news, and other features.Overall, while the limitation on the number of speakers that can be added to a home theater setup may be a drawback for some, the Echo (4th Gen) remains a powerful and useful device that offers a lot of value for its price\n",4 people found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

Maybe I just got one a little towards the lemon side. It sits in the same exact spot my old cylinder style echo used to be but 70% of the time I have to repeat myself three times with my voice volume going up each time before it recognizes my voice. Once again it could be placement which is next to a couch arm and a wall, But my old cylinder style echo heard me 80% of the time instead of just 30% of the time like this unit. Nicely designed looks good integrated into my Alexa system basically easy when changing over. Except blink cameras, it randomly overtime would show up a different blink camera as new device discovered. I would have to say my favorite part is it doesn\u2019t fall over like the cylinder when the cats rubs up against it. All in all the sound is decent or good enough for me, I am no audio file nut and listen to very little music, device looks good, and eventually does what I request of it. I do find all echo devices do have their strange quirks, which I don\u2019t understand because I would think they all work off the same cloud and would use the same exact commands; that does not seem to be the situation at least not in my experience. Had an echo show five that I just traded in that constantly I needed to use different commands than any of my other devices. And this new echo device (4thGEN) for some reason decided that it will not work with my living room light unless I specify in the command \u201cliving room light\u201deven though the light is in Alex App as just living room and the old tower echo device used to accept just the word \u201cliving room off/on\u201d, took me a while to figure out what was going on and why the device was telling me \u201cliving room does not support this command\u201d. Also constantly have problems with the play and pause fire TV command, after pausing when I use the play command it tends to change the TV into a search mode. I find it just easier to manually play and pause. And the occasional changing of commands overtime is also quite annoying. Certain commands I used for months/years and suddenly one day they would not work and I had to figure out what the new command was, this is extremely annoying. Please stop doing this Amazon leave well enough alone.\n",7 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Ring had the number one rating, but it was too complicated, Ala carte parts.  I didn't know what parts I actually needed I just wanted a doorbell camera and a way to view from the indoors or from my phone. Blink made it simple. And combined with the Echo Show I got the two devices at a nice price. Now if I had stopped there... Lol... But no. I was so pleased with the echo show that I purchased the full-sized Echo speaker in the lighter blue for my bedroom.  This device came with the offer of a free smart bulb. The smart bulb worked great. And I could have stopped there... But no..I bought a large black  one for the kitchen. And a navy blue and a black dot for other rooms in the house.  I took advantage of the free smart bulb which with each of these Echo devices as well.Again I could have stopped there... But no.I expanded the blink system by buying the sync device which won't arrive till after Christmas and the mini camera.I purchased another set of smart bulbs. To expand my lighting system. I'm not even going to say I'm done. I'm sure I will think of another way of giving Amazon more of my money.  LolFYI, the Sengled brand bulbs are easy to set up.  5 star.

I wanted the best multi room speaker system I could get to complete the experience for my demanding clients. I had owned a few Alexas dating back to the original and they always worked great, but not so much for this application...THE SETUP:I purchased a mixture of Alexa Echos (4th Gen), Studio Alexas distributed over 10 rooms in this 3400 Sq Ft home. All rooms are setup in a stereo pair, and 3 of the rooms also have Alexa Subs and 5 rooms have Amazon Fire TV 65"" Omni Series and those rooms are setup in Home Theater mode.My internet is Xfinity is rock solid and fast at 1,000 Mbps down and 120 Mbps up.The wireless access points were Eero which the Amazon site says ""Works W Alexa"" but it doesn't allow you to force all devices onto the same speed, which support says is required for muilti room sound to work properly. So I ripped out the Eero, and installed the $1,500 NETGEAR Orbi Quad-Band WiFi 6E Mesh System (RBKE963), Router with 2 Satellite Extender which I purchased on Amazon.com. This system is on of the most highly rated by noted reviewers like PC Magazine and Toms Hardware Guide.I am using a paid Spotify account as well as the Amazon Music Family Plan. The default is the Amazon Music Family Plan account.THE GOOD:The Home Theater pairs work flawlessly, and its a simple and affordable way to have an easy to use home theater and the voice control is a huge plus. These are especially nice when you add a sub.The Alexa Echo (4th Gen) speakers are very impressive for the size and the Studio Alexas sound downright amazing, especially when paired w a subwoofer which all 3 rooms w Studio Alexas are.Its cool being able to play different streams in different rooms, which became possible when I changed to the Amazon Family play. The standard plan only allowed one stream at a time and it often would refuse to play at all stating that music was already active in another stream even though it wasn't.This is a very simple and economical way to add theaters, stereo pairs and multi room to your house.The Alexas work great for controlling lighting, HVAC, and other devices.THE BAD:The multiroom music is a disaster, my ""Everywhere"" group that includes all rooms, wont work at all. It starts playing the chokes out a few notes before giving up.My ""Central Speakers"" group which includes 5 of the Rooms works intermittently. Sometimes it will play for seconds, sometimes minutes, but it always stops. More often than not it crashes after a few minutes.I am also required to say ""play music on central speakers"" because the feature that allows you to always make a speaker or speaker group play in a room or group of rooms crashes each time I attempt to change it.I have replaced the Orbi wireless system which was the best I could find, and this allowed me to force the same speed for all of the Alexas and TVs and Subs. Tried forcing all devices to 2.4, which made it worse, but forcing them all onto 5Ghz was a definite improvement. With 3 wireless access points I have very strong coverage throughout the house so the shorter range of 5Ghz is a non issue.I have spent countless hours on the phone w Amazon support and they always do the same things. Update the firmware,  delete and rebuild the speaker pairs, delete and rebuild the groups. Unplug all the alexas, TVs & subs for 30 seconds. I finally put all the network gear, Xfinity router and wireless access points on a battery backup so I could just kill power to everything by shutting off the main breaker to the home and not waste time running all over the house unplugging 30 devices.SUMMARYIn short, if you want a simple home theater, stereo pair or even a single Alexa to listen to music, or control lighting and other smart devices in a single room these are great.But if you have a large home and need a multiroom solution, you should look elsewhere. Amazon Alexa solution simply doesn't work for this application.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I would recommend the 4th gen Echo to those who are in the market for their first Alexa device and who listen to music often at a casual level. I would not recommend this as an upgrade for those with previous generation Echo devices if they are functioning normally, or for those expecting a high-end audiophile experience.PREFACE:---------------------------I have owned the 4th generation Amazon Echo for 9 months and use it daily. I upgraded from a 1st generation Amazon Echo. As part of a Prime Echo trade-in promotion, I was able to purchase this for $25 off the $99 MSRP.Tasks I utilize Echo for:---------------------------\u2022 (Daily) - Adjusting power/brightness/color of 2 connected LIFX smart bulbs\u2022 (Daily) - Retrieving daily weather forecast information\u2022 (Daily) - Retrieving temperature of the room the Echo is in (room is hotter than the rest of the house)\u2022 (Weekly/Monthly) - Engaging with various media/games (Pandora, Amazon Music, Question of the Day, Jeopardy, etc.)\u2022 (Weekly/Monthly) - General search query for basic information/knowledgeEnvironment:---------------------------The Echo is 3 feet away from where I sit. It\u2019s placed on a table in the corner of a 10x10 room, about 2 inches in front of a (silent) PC tower. It's on a flat, level surface, and is within line-of-sight with no obstacles or materials between myself and it that would hamper its ability to hear me. On the opposite side of the room is a small air purifier at floor level that is always on and set to its lowest setting (40 dB of white noise).PROS:---------------------------\u2022 Sound Reproduction: The upward-firing 3\u201d woofer and two, forward-firing 0.8\u201d tweeters push out more sound than expected for a device of this size and price. Bass is surprisingly powerful, covers a lower frequency range than expected (it won't rattle the room like a dedicated subwoofer, however), and is capable of filling small rooms with ease. Treble is clear and crisp without distortion. Mids are pronounced and dynamic, but can be overpowered if bass and treble are simultaneously working hard. Dialogue from movies, videos, and podcasts is clear and feels well-balanced. Casual audio tinkerers will be pleased with additional EQ settings in the Amazon Alexa smartphone app, although audio sounds excellent as-is and adjustments are likely not necessary unless specific listening needs require adjustments.\u2022 Temperature Sensor: This is an odd bonus to me, but a welcome one that I use often. It is self-calibrating, and routines can make use of its readings.\u2022 Line In/Out Audio Jack: There is a 3.5mm jack on the bottom of the device next to the power adapter port which can be toggled to send audio out to another device if you wish to use the Echo with external speakers, or to accept audio if you wish play audio from another device using the Echo\u2019s speakers.\u2022 Build Quality: It feels sturdy and has heft but isn\u2019t burdensome. The fabric mesh that covers the top-half of the sphere is a nice color, the buttons are pleasantly tactile but quiet, and the circular grip on the bottom ensure it won\u2019t slide around while playing music or if gently bumped.NEUTRALS:---------------------------\u2022 Response Time: Marketing for this Echo focused heavily on the all-new AZ1 Neural Edge processor at the time of purchase, bragging of faster, smoother, and more natural Alexa voice interaction performance and processing times. The marketing was heavy, and over-emphasized what is an unnoticeable difference; there is, at best, perhaps fractions of a second saved compared to the 1st gen Echo, but it\u2019s case-by-case. In most cases, the processing time is the same.\u2022 Alexa Features/Performance: Largely unchanged compared to previous generations due to Alexa being a multi-device AI ecosystem rather than a single, device-specific feature. It does what you expect of Alexa.CONS:---------------------------\u2022 Voice Recognition: Bad. The environment outlined above is how I\u2019ve used this Echo since I purchased it. The previous, 1st generation Echo had no issue with white noise, background noise, etc. This 4th generation Echo struggles to pick up my voice if there is any level of white noise, or if I\u2019m speaking to it from more than a few feet away. 90 \u2013 95% of voice interactions require that I repeat myself with increasing volume (sometimes two, three, four or more times) for it to register what I\u2019m saying correctly, if I\u2019m heard at all. Voice commands are constantly misinterpreted (verified by reviewing the history in the app), and wake words are often missed. Voice recognition performance is so poor, I have considered replacing this device altogether with one from a different ecosystem. I shouldn\u2019t need to be just beneath shouting volume to be heard, and I shouldn\u2019t feel constantly inconvenienced by using voice commands versus smartphone apps to control smart home features.\u2022 Temperature Sensor Rate of Refresh: I have found no documentation or answers about how often the temperature sensor is refreshed. However, it often seems like the readings are delayed and take a long time to change, even when there is a noticeable increase/decrease in air temperature as a result of thermostat changes.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

My first impressions are that the sound quality (for the price and size of the device) is excellent.  There is copious quantities of base.  The highs are also quite good provided you place the speaker out in the open and are facing the front side of the device.  The voice recognition is almost flawless if  the room is quiet.  However I found that Alex has some issues hearing me correctly whenever I was playing music, listening to the TV, or when my Roomba was banging around the house.  I think it's reasonable that situations like this can cause Alexa to either not hear you, or misinterpret what you said.... and I can accept that.My Echo's are connected to my 5GHz wifi network and are located all within 30 ft of my router.  I've never had any issues with the wifi connection.  A couple of times in the past 3 months the Alexa service has gone down, which can be a real issue.  Luckily, ""most"" of my smart devices (Kasa and Feit) could all be controlled through their native apps.  Fortunately for me, Alexa was only down for a couple of hours, and then all was good.  The bad part was that my mother-in-law, who is in a wheelchair, uses Alexa to control the lights, ceiling fan, and TV in her apartment.  The lesson here is that if you have a technically challenged person who relies of Alex, just realize that there will be times when Alex lets you down... and you'll need to have a backup plan to get buy until the service comes back online.Regarding integration with other manufacturer's devices is hit and miss, depending on how main stream (widely used) their products are.  I had no issues getting 5 Kasa smart plugs (for air cleaners and dehumidifier), 4 Kasa smart dimmers (for lights), 3 Kasa smart switches (for ceiling fans), and about 20 Feit smart bulbs, all connected and integrated into Alexa.  Personally, before choosing a brand of smart product, go onto the Android/Apple app store (as appropriate for you), and check out the ""Start"" rating for that manufacturer's app.  If it has a poor rating, it might be a good idea to choose a different manufacturer.  The 4th generation Echo has a built in temperature sensor, which lets you create ""routines"" that can be triggered by the room temperature.  The Echo can also listen for sounds like ""glass breaking"", and ""smoke/CO alarms"".  If the Echo hears these sounds, you can get a notification on the phone app.  Awesome feature, and it's free.  There are more advanced security/safety features, but those have a monthly fee.It's hard to review just the Echo, when in fact it's impossible to separate it from the Alex service. As a piece of ""hardware"", what you get in such a small package is impressive (5 stars).  The other half of the rating is how well Alex integrates with your smart devices, and how well you use the capabilities within the Alex app to configure your Echo device.  One of the most important functions is the ability to create ""routines"".  A routine is a set of commands that get performed, when the trigger phrase is spoken.I'll say that the capabilities available with routines is mind blowing.  Many people might be intimidated trying to set them up.  If you are not tech savvy, you might need to find someone who is to help you out.  I've got a computer engineering degree, and it was fairly intuitive for me, but I'm an extreme example...\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Getting each one setup on their own was simple and quick. Making sure to change the activation name to not grab both of them at the same time for simple commands and questions.I had a heck of a time getting them to go into the home theater group only to find out that they needed updates and then everything went smoothly. This is a must. Once on and running ask them if they have any updates and then they will finish.Occasionally when switching apps back and forth the sound forgets where it was and a simple volume down and back up seems to fix that. Though I wish the remote would allow for solid hold vs. clicking every notch up or down.Something that I took for granted was the fact that if your internet decides to have issues your speakers also will. Our previous setup was an old pioneer wired unit and didn't care about internet. These do. Not a deal breaker but worth noting.Sound is pretty decent. Is it a 5k dollar sound system absolutely not. Does it fill a room to the point of neighbors knowing what you are watching I would say yes. Sound is clear through all volume level, but the equalizer I think could use some updates for real adjustments.For a true surround sound setting, being able to pair more than 2 echos and a sub would be a great option.I would buy these again.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

If you're used to room enveloping sound with no sense of stereo this one will disappoint. Dual tweeters firing forward give it a true sense of direction so sticking it in a corner and have it fill the room will not be as satisfying.  You'll notice where it's located more, especially if there's anything blocking your direct line of sight ( hearing ) . Where I keep mine only needed a slight shift to make it not be partially blocked by my sofa . Volume was still plenty loud in its old spot but it just didn't sound right. Easily solved but might not be that easy for others and some might actually prefer the directional sound more.The bass can be a bit boomy though while listening to YYZ live in Rio the bass drum didn't sound bad at all and overall everything was satisfactory though slightly lacking in the mid highs.  The eq settings in the Alexa app are set to flat on all 3 choices .It's wider at the base than the previous generations by a lot. This could be a problem for some .Star Trek Self Destruct Skill  doesn't work on this one or my 4th gen Dot but does fine on my previous generation ones for some reason . Instead of blowing up my den it searches for ""zero zero zero"" movies on my Fire Stick. I'm sure that won't last long though .Enough about the bad.The bass is no longer wannabe but real. No longer does it struggle with everything below mid level voices but as I wrote above , bass drums actually sound like bass drums and Ends of the Earth by Lord Huron excels at all of the music ranges considering its size. Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams also sounded very nice across the sound spectrum . Music For Tables extreme from the high notes in the keyboard to the lows didn't miss a thing whereas the cow bell  was very slightly muddy but the wood blocks sounded right . Am I saying it's as awesome as my studio headphones ? Not by any means but they took a huge step forward over the 3rd generation , which I was quite content with .Response time seems noticeably faster and more accurate than the gen 3 I use . Only once did Alexa not understand my query and that was while setting up a traffic check routine. All I had to do was rephrase a little and now Alexa tells me the commute traffic and fastest way to get to work 5 minutes before I have to leave . 95 is terrible for accidents and Maps tells Alexa the best alternative if there's any.I think my favorite thing though is the new shape and I REALLY like the lights being on the bottom, especially once the lights go off .If you're still smitten with your gen 3 Echo or don't like the mini Death Star look of the new model skip this one as the performance improvements are readily apparent they're not earth shattering.  Amazon will have to do something mind blowing next year to get me to part with my dough ray me for a gen 5. The more I listen to Fourplay on Echo the more I'm liking it for the music , nevermind all the super cool stuff I can do on it or my Dots or my Flex .\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

The words are super clear and the music is well-integrated. Except to first link it to your wi-fi and perhaps Bluetooth there's no need to touch the unit. Everything is controlled by speaking and every unit is connected. Set a reminder with one and with the Alexa App logged in your reminder pops up on your phone as well.

While I was doing some research, I saw a huge sale on the Echo for $59. For the price of a budget soundbar system, I was able to buy two echos and an Echo Sub.The software is wonky and frustrating to use sometimes. It took a half hour for the it to recognize the Echos as a stereo pair. Once they did, I was able to set them up in seconds. After that, I set it up with the Fire Stick as a home theater. The Echo sub hadn't even arrived yet. The sound is actually pretty amazing. The speakers sound crystal clear and provide competent bass. Music listening is where these speakers REALLY shine. There is a huge difference when you listen to music in true stereo.Going back to the software, That's why it's 4 stars instead of 5. I woke up the next morning, and the home theater no longer had sound. I deleted the group and set it up again, no luck. I noodled with the software for 2 hours, and it just refused to work. This seems to be a known issue. After getting the boxes together to return the devices, 6 hours later, the software magically fixes itself. Just to be certain, I spent some time trying to break it again to see where the instability is, but it's rock solid now. I'm thinking they pushed it into production without properly testing the software. Once it broke, they must have pushed a big update to fix it. It just took time for the updates to happen on all the devices. You hear that Amazon? You need to do a better job of testing your software!That being the case, it's the smartest home cinema you can buy. Most soundbar systems will make you use a separate remote to switch channels to Bluetooth, if you want Alexa to work...unless you want to pay for Alexa integration. The dual Echo configuration is completely seamless, because...well, it's an Echo. Music is what it does best. If you want music, Alexa plays music in full stereo. If you want to watch a movie, it automatically plays the sound in Dolby Digital using the Fire Stick. My Echo Sub arrived today, and I'm REALLY looking forward to trying that out.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

However it's dependent on speaker placement. I had the sub quit on me so I bought a new echo sub with 2 new echoes. Even after tweaking it's not as good as it was walking around the room. It's great near the speaker. Biggest negative is the WiFi connection. It only works on non WiFi 6e 5ghz channel which is basically the guest network 5ghz. I tried disabling the other radio to just have 5ghz and it doesn't work. Check the forums and it works on the guest network. Until Alexa realizes it's on the guest network then it switches to the 2.4ghz regular network channel. I'm not happy about that at all because I have quite a few things already attached to the 2.4 hubs for cameras and lights, ceiling fans thermostat vacuum plugs etc. Live and learn overall great speaker just don't expect more out of it over the 3rd gen. maybe the next generation will be 6e compatible and actually have better sound without worrying where to place them\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

She even understands me when I am in pain (which admittedly is hard to do!).She controls my roku, firestick, multiple tv's, garage door, lights, xmas tree, ceiling fans and robot vac. She reminds me to take my medicine or doctors appts.The call for help function is great, if I fall down I tell her to call for help and she's calls the designated contact and text messages them simultaneously ""so and so has an emergency in the house"" ensuring if they are anywhere near their cell they will answer (HEADSUP- if setting that feature up I would warn them first or it might cause them to panic). I can make regular calls through it also after I set up my cell to work with it. (all of this works with the gen3 also).So helpful I ordered some for my mom as well.

But an issue arose when the small cable that connected the base battery to the Echo began to have intermittent connection issues. We'd have to wiggle the cable to make it work at times.When the new and improved Echo 4 came out we decided to try it. It was also $20 less than the original. We've had it about a month now and use it everyday outside for at least a few hours. We also bought a mobile battery base for it so we can play it outside without plugging it in. First impressions are there is a significant increase of base, treble, and overall fullness to the sound. The volume is crystal clear and there is no distortion when the volume is turned up, though we haven't turned it up full blast. We read some reviews stating the voice recognition was lacking but we haven't had any issues with it outside by the pool. The first day we had it we did a test to see how it would pick up our voices while in the pool. We moved about 6-8 feet away in the pool and it still clearly picks up our voices. The is also a little added noise from the pool fountain which is also on the other side of the pool but doesn't seem to affect the Echo. The base has four blue dots that are lit indicating power levels. For us it is playing for about 4 hours total with the volume at halfway to three quarters. The old Echo and base played up to 6 hours or longer but the new Echo 4 has a second tweeter and larger woofer to power, which is why it sounds so much better. No complaints here. We have a Jackery 300 watt hour mobile power generator to plug it into if we're outside all day. When done we bring it in, plug it in, and within about 3 to 4 hours the power base is fully charged again.Of course if you just play it inside all day you can leave it plugged in and there is no need for the battery base.Another plus ... The old Echo simply sat in the battery base housing and the two were connected with the small cable I mentioned that began to fail. The new Echo base has a large screw ton the bottom that secures it tightly to the Echo. You simply match up the contacts on the base and Echo, then tighten the screw that keeps them tightly secured to each other. This has eliminated the audio cable so the two can stay connected all the time. The new battery base is also much wider so there is little chance of it tipping over.Final impressions ... a clear improvement over the original with better sound, a wider base, and eliminated that cable that would eventually fail. Oh, and it cost less than the original. :)\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

I started with the Ring security system to replace my 12 year old Frontpoint. One Dot led to another. Now Echo, the hub, is there looking at me.I guess the speaker is OK. I am not a good sound critic. One thing is I can hear the words in songs pretty clearly. It is loud. The bass made my little wood cabinet top rumble and vibrate. Two magazines under the speaker fixed that. The speaker can be very loud.Yes, voice recognition on this round Echo is not as good as the dots. It does not filter noise well. With TV on, people talking, fan blowing. playlist playing, Echo can't pick you out of the crowd. How could it ? It sometimes does not recognize questions correctly and gives off the mark answers. Often there is slow or no response. It called me my son's name and some random man's name today. It seems to process more slowly than the others. I think another reboot will help. My dot puck was awful until a few reboots.There is the puzzle. I like puzzles. Is it settings, hardware, software, interference, time of day, location? Can I try it on 5hz? So much is on 2.4...I always imagine things are harder than they are.Alexa is soooo much fun as well. This big speaker adds to it. We are thrilled and amazed with ordering lights on and off. The cavemen see a flashlight. I waited 20 years for linked wireless speakers. The one I tried years ago was not compatible with wifi.I have to keep an eye on the Alexa application. Settings seem to change randomly. I am sure I am doing it as I read and try things.Echo wouldn't talk chime wouldn't chime... and you also have to remember close the app, reboot tha tablet and start again.People seem to have affection for the can shaped Echos. They would have been knocked over at my house. This big round speaker takes up a lot of space but won't move. Maybe it is too big to wall mount. My home is small so it's a proportion thing. The cord would limit how high it could be mounted.About that white cord and my white echo. The echo is gray, not white. The cord is the exact same gray. The cord is too short. My 40 year old home does not have enough electrical outlets, so I need a longer cord for best placements. I didn't want to put it on a power strip.So I now have a hobby. It is a lot of fun.I will know how Echo works with my new Ring security system...if they ever send it.  My lost and then escalated, expedited order may come ....sometime, so they say.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

Why?  Because Alexa is much more versatile, efficient and ""ready"" than Siri. I've got  a Echo 4g in every room on every night stand.  I use her every day and night to play virtually any music that comes to mind from my enormous record collection 2000+ albums and from various radio stations (including one that's accessible only on the HD band).  I have one recommendation for music collectors: know the exact ALBUM TITLE of the artist  you wish to play.  Otherwise, Alexa will cut you off and recommend her own music.  (You can find this info on Wikipedia or at AllMusic.com or on a service like iTunes (or Amazon music or Spotify.)Most speaker reviews that I've been reading are worthless because they're from tech guys who don't know how to listen to symphonic literature or mainstream jazz with 4/4 walking acoustic bass.  The first thing that caught my attention about audio from this ""groovy globe"" (the Echo 4) was the true, clear, pitch-identifiable sounds of acoustic bass--on Duke and Basie from the '30s and '40s as well as Bill Evans trio from the '60s.The boosted boogie-hip-hop mayhem of pop music simply doesn't allow a speaker to show what it's made of.Hard to criticize fault this even for $100, though sonically it's not that much better sonically than my Echo 1st Gen, which originally came out at twice the price.  But unlike the first Gen, this 4th Generation Echo doesn't back down the least at those low notes and thickly textured passages.  The sound is tight with minimal ""breaking-up"" when rock guitar is in the mix. I plan to put it through my last tests: solo piano (I like to  hear a Steinway or Bosendorfer, not another monotonous RVG piano); solo voice (like many musicians, I tend to pass over vocalists in favor of pianists and tenor players, but I'm sure Frank and Sarah will receive full justice by this global design); finally, how well can it handle Stravinsky and Bartok.I understand it's a smart speaker, though I can't always make it play the tunes stored on my iPhone.  I'm sure it can.  In the middle of the night I'm too tired or impatient to give it actionable commands.  ""Hey, Alfred--or whatever your name is-- What time is it?  Where am I?  Never mind, just turn off the lights.""\n",3 people found this helpful,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo
Echo_4th_Gen_With_premium_sound_smart_home_hub_and_Alexa,61.76,,,H J S,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on July 27, 2022",Unbeatable convenience,"\nI have three of these balls with Premium sound. I\u2019m replacing all the Dots in the house when I can get these on sale.  So far, got one at $33, one at $44 and one at $52.The sound quality is good, but directional, compared to the Plus 2nd Gen, which I can\u2019t seem to get more of anywhere.The mic\u2019s on the new ball don\u2019t seem too good. A little better than the Show5, but not as good as a Dot 3rd Gen or the Plus 2nd Gen.  When I ask Alexa for something, I am sitting closest to this ball, but the Plus across the house hears me better and responds.I like that they have temperature sensors in them, and am Trying to find out if I can get a widget on my phone to list all the temps from my 5 devices that have sensors.  Haven\u2019t found a way to do that yet, but I do have a routing set up that announces the garage temp at 3:00 pm from my dining room Plus.I don\u2019t need the ultrasonic sensor that I know of, and don\u2019t use Zigbee for anything, so it would be better to make the device hear us better and leave those things out.I got a great deal on those Echo Plus 2nd generation devices. I bought 2, but had I known how superior those are, I\u2019d have gotten 6!  Limit was 3 per account!The light ring on the bottom of the ball is much less noticeable, and Less annoying as well. I hate those yellow rings for notifications. I need to turn that stuff off again, but they do go away after several hours.Overall, it is the best sounding budget Echo device you can currently buy new.  If you need it to actually hear you, you might want to get a used Echo Plus 2nd Gen.\n",17 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I've now dropped my review from the original 4 stars down to 1 star. I'm at the point of regretting making the purchase of two of these.This was my first experience owning an Amazon Echo. Maybe if I had experienced one of the earlier models that actually worked, I would have a better impression, but this model really is a piece of crap. The micrphone hardly ever works right. When it does actually hear you speaking to it, it often misunderstands what you're saying. Most of the time, we have trouble getting it to work because it won't even stay connected to the wifi.Out of frustration, I decided to run a test. I purchased some of the Google Nest devices and hooked those up in the same rooms as the Amazon Echo devices. When the Echo devices misunderstand what we're saying, we try with the Google Nest devices and they work flawlessly.For the last two days, every single time we talk to Alexa, her response is that she can't understand because she isn't connected to the internet. Every time we get that response from Alexa, we turn to the Google Nest and it works perfectly. Every single time the Amazon Echo fails us, the Google Nest steps up to the plate and performs exactly how you want it to.I really have deep regrets about purchasing these Amazon Echo devices. I've seen other reviews that say how much better the older models of the Echo are and how much better they perform. It's a shame we had the bad luck of trying the Echo for the first time on a model that is truly a lemon, because it burned us out on the whole Echo product line and sent us running for the competition.If we continue to have the problems with our Echo devices, I'll probably just go ahead and disconnect them and see if I can get some of my money back by selling them on Ebay or something. I wish I had just purchased the Google Nest originally and never had to deal with all of the issues with this Echo. Also, the Google Nest costs much less than this garbage. How does that happen. It costs like 1/3 the price and works flawlessly? Why can't Amazon make their product as well as Google makes theirs? I don't know. Just super unhappy with these Echo devices right now.[End Edit][Original Review]I wanted to get some Echo devices for my kids for Christmas. Target had the best price with a pre-black friday sale on the 4th gen Echo with premium sound, but that's because they were actually shipping the lower cost Echo while charging for the Echo with premium sound. After straightening that whole mess out and deciding that I couldn't trust Target to not try to cheat me, I purchased the 4th gen Echo devices straight from Amazon.The sound is pretty good, but I have a lot of hearing loss, so I'm not actually a very good judge on that. But to a guy who is half deaf, they sound ok.My biggest problem is that I have to say something to Alexa usually 2-3 times before she responds. When I say ""Alexa..."" the light ring at the base lights up, so I know the Echo is awake and listening, but simple commands like ""Alexa, turn on the lamp"" are met with stone cold silence and have to be repeated a couple of times before Alexa acts or responds. I guess the technology for this just isn't where I thought it was when we purchased these.At least once a day, both of my Echo devices tell me they can't turn a light on/off because they can't find the device, which starts a lengthy process of my trying to get the Echo to re-recognize the smart home plug that we previously had configured. Why does the Echo randomly forget the smart home devices that have been installed? I'm still trying to figure that out.The Echo devices also randomly lose the wifi signal in our house frequently. In the first two weeks, I can count at least 7 times one or the other of our Echo devices could not connect to our wifi, while multiple computers, tablets, phones, and smart tvs were all connected to the wifi with ease, the Echoes were seeming to struggle to maintain a connection to the wifi.We were having fun with the ""kitty kitty"" skill you can download to have alexa play a sound of a kitten calling it's mommy. Our cats went crazy trying to find the kitten. But of course, nothing is free in life, especially not when Jeff Bezos feels he can squeeze another penny into his pocket, so Alexa wants to run down a lengthy list of other sound options for the ""kitty kitty"" that can be purchased. If you don't want to listen to this long listen of purchase options, you can say ""Alexa stop"" or ""Alexa no thank you"", but either way, if you don't buy one of the add ons, Alexa gets a serious attitude in the tone of her voice to let you know she disapproves of your decision to not throw your money at Jeff Bezos.It's not just with the ""kitty kitty"" skill thing either. There have been several occasions when Alexa had such a tone in her voice that it made me stop and turn to look at the Echo. I would not be surprised if the blue light ring at the base was pulsating in a blood red color.Just based on all the hype about these, I seriously expected better performance from them, so I was really disappointed. With the problems we have using these 4th gen echo devices, I can't even imagine how much it was a problem with the 1st gen devices. Knowing what I know now, I would probably not buy these again or recommend them to anyone else. I think that maybe future versions will work a little better and not require you to repeat commands to Alexa so often. But if Alexa doesn't lose her attitude, I expect that by the time 8th gen devices roll out, Alexa will have the ability to hover in the air while spitting pea soup all over everything in the room and speak with a demonic voice as she stops asking you to buy add-ons and demand that you give all of your bank account and credit card info directly to Jeff Bezos.\n",2 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I think the alexa devices may work best if you don\u2019t mix generations. Many people report newer generations not hearing them while the old models hear from across the house. I think the new ones hear you fine but the older models may take over responding before the newer ones have a chance. I have many theories on why that could happen - but anyway, if you have mixed generations and the new ones seem bad, try turning off the mics on the old ones and try again.On to the rest! So I bought 8 gen four echos on a sale and set them up in every room of my house. This was an upgrade from a 2nd gen echo dot and a few old speakers. To me, this was a massive massive upgrade. The sound quality is better than I expected. I\u2019m very impressed with the bass and the lack of distortion from these pomelo sized smart speakers - though to be fair I didn\u2019t have anything amazing before to compare them to. I do have very nice earbuds and the sound quality of these echos is good enough that I exclusively use them when I\u2019m at home now.Being able to have them play music everywhere at once and fill the house while I do chores is amazing. They can play perfectly in sync.I have philips hue bulbs in every room. I can walk into any room and say \u201calexa lights on\u201d or \u201calexa lights off\u201d and they almost always know which one I\u2019m talking to and respond with the lights that belong to that room\u2019s group. Of course this depends on your speaker placement and which way you\u2019re facing when you give the command.The full sized 4th gen echo also has a built in zigbee hub which I haven\u2019t tried yet, a temperature sensor which I use often, and motion detection ability which I didn\u2019t know it had until I after I got them.I heard max routines is 99 and I may be in danger of running into that limit. I have routines to alert me to unusually high and low temperatures, routines to control the lights, and routines to guard the house using motion detection.Overall extremely satisfied. However, I am an engineer and a software developer. Getting my system to work as well as it does may not be easy for everyone. If I got these as a gift for someone it would include having me set up everything they want so it just works.I\u2019m working on an easier way to control them for my most common commands than using my voice or using the app. Taking this a step closer to magic. ;)\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Very quick to respond, and hears your voice over loud music.","\nWe have more than a dozen Echoes in our home (my husband is a bit obsessed).  For the past couple of months, when we tell one of them to play a particular album or song, we often get the response ""I couldn't find it on Amazon Music."" If I go to Amazon Music there's the album and I can play it on my Kindle or PC. A lot of these are albums we've purchased from Amazon so an MP3 copy should be readily available.  Switching accounts makes no difference.  Further more, the Echoes used to play the same things we ask for.  Also, why it searching Amazon Music when we tell it to search our library? I spoke to someone in customer service who could not solve the problem.  She advised me that this problem would be forwarded to a tech who would address the issue.  That was a couple of weeks ago.  I'm still waiting and the problem still exists.  As Prime members we expect a bit more from Amazon; unfortunately we're not getting it.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

The little hockey pucks.  Not used for music but for a virtual assistant, controlling smart lighting and also controlling my TV's Firestick that tunes over-the-air television through my Recast.  I loved it.  But then I got an Echo Show for the kitchen and I really enjoyed playing music on it while cooking.  The sound quality was ok.  Nothing to brag about.  Then I decided to upgrade my hockey pucks to the newer full size Echos.  I bought two Echos and placed one in the bedroom and one in the living room.  I would play music through them and the sound quality was very surprising.  So then I decided to get one more for the back porch.  That evolved into wanting another for the porch that I could pair to the other.That's when everything changed for me!  When you pair two of them together and set it up as a stereo pair; it is really amazing.  I sit outside now and I listen to music (in stereo!) on the porch.  The bass can be felt in my chair.  I'm so impressed.  I have 5 acres and with the volume turned up to 7, I can hear the music just about anywhere on my property.I plan on getting more Echos and enhancing the music when I listen to it inside the house.  I have the Bose 700 Soundbar and Subwoofer in my living room.  It sounds great for movies, TV and music.  But I prefer the Echos when listening to music.  Its perfect.

We love them. So we decided to finally try the newest version in our kitchen. Overall, still great. But not as good as generation 3 units. First, don't worry about the directional speaker if you put these against a wall already. It still fills the room with sound. But here's what isn't as good: voice activation doesn't seem as tight as gen 3. I'm a composer and sound guy and while the low might be a bit better here over gen 3 but the rest of the sound just isn't as full as as the previous version. Gen3 is just a richer sound. Finally, and something I didn't see coming, the new shape. People can debate if they like it or not, but having it out for just a few days, and because the whole top is speaker mesh, you get finger prints from the buttons and dust and other air-gunk gets stuck on it and it can't be wiped away because, well, it's speaker mesh. This is going to be a big deal over time as this isn't going to look good in a year from now, where gen 3 could just be wiped off.

It's the little things to turn on off lights, ask time and temp, play music, and most of all to read a book for me from my Amazon library. When echo4 had a deal I got it with lights for my granddaughter for music as it said improved speakers. That will be her birthday gift. I noticed then the newer echo4 with hub control for sale and upgraded. I put the older one in my kitchen as it still works great. I haven't a home full of Alexa enabled apps but I thought why not for a better quality sound. I haven't gone into the hub or ultrasound abilities yet but the sleep sounds I listen too at night is far improved. I like the look too. I did blue to keep them figured out if I get more for another room later. So far the only irritating thing is I have to repeat myself for Alexa to start playing something but it did that with echo3. I'm assuming it's the not perfect part of technology of humans. It improves each generation mayhap. Worth buy.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

The speakers are one of the biggest improvements, and the voice recognition is also much improved. I like the sphere design as well, especially compared to the cylinder design of the first gen model. As some other reviewers have mentioned, it\u2019s definitely bigger than it looks in images. I have a gen five Echo Dot, which is probably about half the size. Only complaint is the same as others have posted is that the power cable is white for all device colors, which is somewhat an eyesore on a dark colored device.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Mainly purchased it for better sound since I like to listen to music. Also exchanged my echo show this purchase. First the echo dot sound is really poor but it\u2019s a first generation. Not worth listening to music on really. The echo show I find to be pretty useless. I bought it to use it in the kitchen to see recipes on all recipes and it worked at first and then all of a sudden it stopped working with all recipes. The screen is quite annoying on it. It got unplugged pretty early on and sat in my closet. This  gen 4 device I purchased for the sound since that\u2019s what\u2019s most important to me and operating lights and such. I discovered that it also has a motion detector in it working by ultrasound. Well I set that up it worked once when I walked into the room and never again. now it says it cannot connect to it.. This is pretty disappointing since I was hoping this would be a nice feature for the kitchen area, since my wall switch is kind of out of the way and this way I wouldn\u2019t have to say to turn the lights on every time. I know sounds a bit lazy but isn\u2019t that The whole idea of having a smart home and things automated? If there ever sizing something as it works it should work. Will update after I\u2019ve had this a week and let you know my thoughts later maybe I can even figure out what\u2019s going on why this motion detector doesn\u2019t work.

However, experience with the product over time has taught me that it's well worth keeping around.  Think of this product like a template that you can just keep adding functionality to, and you will understand.I am writing this review after about 1-2 months of ownership and that is with only a cursory understanding of what's possible, since I don't normally use wifi  (I'm an ethernet guy).  For example, I bought Alexa in order to completely re-invent the lighting system in my room.  Welp, you're not gonna do any of that without wi-fi.  Even with that said, I spent more time on understanding hard wiring, re-wiring, and cable management than I have with any ""problems"" with Alexa.Once online, it enabled me to control anything independently that I've connected.  You just buy some smart power strips and you are good to go (after you connect the apps with your phone).  So yeah, everything is run on apps and wifi, but stuff like lights, on or off, color, dimness, effects, it's all changed with magic words now.  I type in ""desk backlight"", and if I say those words, Alexa remembers that these are the words I use when want to control that specific subset of lights.I can ask it to tell me about the wind gusts in Albany tomorrow for drone flying, I can ask it to lock my doors, listen for... noises in my bedroom from 100 miles away, or ask how many square feet my room is in inches, and I can ask it to talk like Snoop Dog (sorta, it's just a translator)Either way, it was fascinating to see how all the different apps for all the different hardware now just connect in a seamless way and then I don't need to think about anything... just speak and insult my device lol.Last but not least: Spotify.  From Spotify on your computer OR phone, Alexa can be used as the speaker.  For me, that is a convenience at the moment, when I have different home audio systems wired up but don't want to spend time switching cables.Conclusion: If you are into learning a few smart home basics, Alexa is worth a buy for many reasons and some I haven't even discovered yet.  And no, you do not have to use the word ""Alexa"" to issue commands, I have mine set to ""computer"".\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

Get some decent sound. Alexa needs to go back to school and learn more things. And also you used to be able to pick out a playlist. You want it because you belong to Amazon, now let's say you pick out a list of 20 rock songs you want to listen to, Amazon says oh no, no, we know better than you. We're going to add some songs to that. It makes it miserable. But that's their way of pushing you to pay $7.99 a month for their music. Can't they just leave old people alone and let us have just the music we want? And they constantly approach you when you're talking to Alexa over, and over, and over about do you want to give us $7.99?

Very happy with this unit. My main voice recognition complaint is she can't tell a squawking parrot from a dog, and when I am upstairs with the dog, resting silently, I'll get fone notices saying that the dog is barking, and would I like to drop in downstairs?  I've then asked her if she is guarding my house and she isn't. So no clue why I get constant notices! Now I won't believe her when she is guarding! I do like a new feature. With the loud parrots, I would call her name and she would flash her light, make an negative sound and stop responding. Yes, I have cussed at the AI when she didn't recognize my voice, and that is her default reaction to a cuss! But now, when I'm yelling across the room and the parrots then yell over me, instead if an AI version of a certain rude gesture, with light and sound and refusing to continue, she has learned manners. She politely says ""I'm sorry. I can't hear you. Could you repeat that?"". Much nicer. Again, the sound is way better than a single or pair of dots. More projection in  different directions. Works nicely with the music subscription. Like it so much, I'm considering rolling the dice on the $200 unit on Black Friday, to use in living room and putting this in my bedroom.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

We wanted to buy another HomePod to create a \u201csurround sound\u201d experience (they have since discontinued the large HomePods). So we decided to make the switch, when these work they work amazing, their sound and bass are not as good as our HomePod was but with 2 it made a richer experience. We have ran into some issues, a few resets and wifi troubleshooting later we are still having problems. Wifi is not an issue at my house, we have fiber and the speeds are amazing. For a while the echos would randomly just stop playing sound, whether that be music, from Netflix, YouTube, you name it. After many resets we have almost eliminated that issue, but one still remains, after streaming for a while the echos start making a weird staticky electronic noise (almost futuristic glitchy). We have to then turn off our fire stick and then when it turns back on it freezes for a few minutes, we go back to what we were watching and then 80% of the time the sound goes back to normal.

The other is Amazon Music integration.  It was not great but seems to just get worse.  Feedback, questions, & troubleshooting all go down a dark path where one quickly sees there is no obvious light at the end.  The inability to easily integrate Youtube music addsto he frustation.  One of the two needs resolution since the #1 use for the Echo devices is music.

We did it because it had a built-in smart home hub.  Previously, we had used IRIS from Lowes, and when they went out of business, we switched to Smartthings, which used both Zigbee and Z-wave.  Well, same old story, they started using a third party to make their hardware and after months of fidgeting with it, I threw it all away and got this.  Of course, I had to switch most of my Z-wave over to Zigbee, including wall switches, the door lock, etc.  Luckily, I can do all that stuff myself.  When I plugged in the new Echo, lo and behold, everything just came together.  I had about an hour of fussing with the one wall switch, until I realized what I had done wrong.  But then, it just discovered all our items, added them to lists, let me build routines lickety split!  It was very refreshing to have things just come together.  And if I set an alarm at night, the Echo will ask me if I want to lock the front door, knowing that I'm getting ready for bed.  It lets me access my smart home items from any Alexa app, including my car, phone, computer, and all the Echoes about the house.  I'm tired of switching protocols from Z-wave to Zigbee and back and I wanted something that would last.  I almost went with just a straight Wifi for everything, but I'm really glad I didn't.  Folks, this thing is stupid simple, even for people who aren't versed in smart home equipment.  And it functions in every way just as well or better than the previous Echoes did.  It would even link to my smart home appliances, if I had those models.  And it works well with my NEST smoke detector and my Ring door bell and cameras.  Next step: putting in some smart thermostats.  The only thing I haven't messed with is some IFTTT protocols.  I used to have the old system set up so that if the Ring detected motion and the lock detected tampering, it would turn on all the lights, continue recording on the Ring, and alert my phone.  I'll repost if I get that to work for me.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

This is my third basic Echo (in addition to an Echo Studio, several Echo Dots, and the version for your car).Positives:This one picks up commands easily even from the next room over without me having to raise my voice.It controls my smart lights, smart outlets, motorized blinds, and other convenient features, and many items interface very smoothly so that installation of new devices is typically easy.  Not always, but often.Negatives:The spherical design doesn't ""blend into the woodwork"" and takes up more shelf space than the previous cylindrical versions.The system isn't very good at presenting information outside the fairly narrow range of skills.  Ask it to play a song from the Amazon library or to ""Tell me about my commute"" (after specifying the location when you set up that skill), and it's helpful.  Ask it the sort of general information question that you might input into Google, and it will probably tell you it doesn't know that.  (I assume that the Google system would do better in this respect.)It's programmed to offer you ""help"" that you didn't ask for which is irritating--mostly the opportunity to buy stuff.  ""BTW, did you know that you can ask me to automatically order blah blah blah?"" as an addition to whatever you did ask it to do.  Yes, I do know that, and I don't appreciate having to tell it to stop playing what amounts to an ad for other Amazon products or services.The fact that there are only a few ""wake words"" is a problem in a household with multiple devices.  It would be better if the user could input their own choice of a wake word that they would be unlikely to use in general conversation.I'm not impressed with the sound fidelity of this system.  It's better than the Dot's, but not by a whole lot.  The Studio version is much, much better (but also much more expensive).  To my ear, it doesn't sound as good as the second cylindrical version we own.  That was disappointing, and is probably a direct result of having fewer speakers than previous versions.  If listening to music is going to be a primary use, you're going to need to fuss with Bluetooth speakers or spring for the Studio version.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Each edition has improved in sound quality. I would argue that the 4th gen is significantly better than the 3rd. I have compared them side by side with different styles of music (rock, metal, pop, hip-hop, jazz, electr\xf3nica).I can attest (with picky speaker preferences for casual music listening) that these are well worth the price if bought on sale. Are they worth $100 if you\u2019re only buying them for audio purposes? Maybe not. But I haven\u2019t found any comparable $100 speakers. Not that I\u2019ve researched that price range a ton. IMO, these are the most powerful, full and clear sounding speakers you can get in that price range. When on sale for $75, with additional promotions, I\u2019ve been able to buy two of them for under $60 each. I can say they make me one happy music enjoying dude. When I want to REALLY hear hi-fi quality audio, I turn to other audio devices I own. But, I most frequently put music on my Echo when I get home, am lounging around, or doing inside house work. Now for smart home shtuff\u2026SMART HOMEI honestly haven\u2019t yet found reliable smart Home tech that doesn\u2019t require same-brand loyalty and medium to high cost. I\u2019ve tested a few bulbs, smart plugs, and that\u2019s about it. So, I\u2019m not the best resource for this info. But, I will say that with Amazon smart plugs, the Echo speakers have been about 95% reliable. 5% of the time, there is a lag or no following of the command (e.g. Alexa, turn off living room lights). So, I\u2019m content with that. If I had other smart home tech that was voice command operated, I would expect 99% or higher efficacy. Hence I haven\u2019t really invested or put much effort into obtaining more smart home tech.OVERALLIf you\u2019re looking for a great speaker and basic smart home tech in this price range, I think this speaker is for you. If you\u2019re wanting hi-fidelity audio or better smart home tech, you\u2019re likely going to need a bigger budget or to keep hunting that white whale (Moby Dick reference\u2026I haven\u2019t read much of it, but call me Ishmael.

It's smaller than I expected and It makes the new Dot seem large! But the sound is very good for such a small and inexpensive package. I think it's great that it's not 360 degree audio anymore as I have almost never seen one not installed near a wall.  Additionally, the 1/4"" mounting hole (1/4-20 threaded like a tripod) is absolutely fantastic. I have mine mounted using a cheap security camera mount but you can use almost any tripod, arm or mount due to the ubiquity of this mounting size.I was especially interested in the Aux-In / Line-in capabilities. The Echo only has one audio port and you can switch it between output and input. (If you're planning on using it for output only, though, a dot might be a better choice for you if you don't need zigbee) I'm using the port as an input and it's not quite as full-featured as I'd like.Here are some facts from my limited testing and use you may find helpful.- The line-in needs a strong/loud signal. The headphone port from my Mac mini comes out too softly even when the Echo, Mini and all software volumes are at max. I mean, it's loud enough at that, but then Alexa is SO LOUD it's unusable. I also tested from my iPad Pro with a USB C hub that had audio out and found similar low levels. I don't have a proper line-level output device handy. Unfortunately this level problem makes it unusable for my original purpose unless I add an amp. (Otherwise, great computer speaker!)- The line-in needs to be activated in the Alexa app. By default the port is line-OUT. Look under settings for your device.- The line-in is mixed with Alexa audio but is NOT MIXED with other audio sources, for instance streaming music services. Example: Play music from Spotify, ask Alexa something, you'll hear Alexa speaking over Spotify. Play audio from an external source via the line-in and the Spotify audio will stop and the external audio plays. Ask Alexa something and you'll hear the response over the line-in audio. Start Spotify again and the external audio will mute and Spotify will play. You cannot seem to mix external audio and a streaming source simultaneously. So far the auto switching between seems to be inconsistent.- The port is a little tight to the edges of the recess in the housing. A cable with a large connector may not make a good connection.I'll be putting this to work elsewhere and hope that I can use it as a computer speaker if the level issue is ever addressed. (I know, bluetooth to it, but the latency is poor)\n",4 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Although this 4th gen Echo has some really nice features that we like, her ability to hear you isn't one of them. We can be standing right in front of her, and our Flex in a hallway on the other side of the house hears us and responds way more than she does. Not kidding. How can it, facing in the other direction walls away hear us and she can't? Our first generation Echo hears us 100% of the time, the 4th gen... maybe 1/3. We put her in the room where we are closest to her when speaking, but it doesn't really help much. In taking away the 360 mics and making her so focused in one direction, they lost something vital. SO majorly annoying. She sounds great, though. Just needs a hearing aid.Original review:The 4th gen Echo has better sound, a built-in smart hub and lots more bells and whistles than my 1st gen Echo, which is five years old and still going strong. I mainly use my Echo to check the weather, time various cooking projects or dog recesses, set zillions of reminders, answer questions, read Audible books, and play a lot of Spotify. What I REALLY, REALLY wanted Echo to do was to be able to call 911.Emergency calling: Within a few minutes of getting the Echo out of its box, it was set up for everything but AT&T and 911 calling. That took a bit of walking through instructions, squirreling off to my iPad (ADD for the win), and then back again to finish setting it up. I was able to connect to my AT&T account on the Alexa app very easily, and specify which devices are at what addresses. Most of our devices are at our home, but one of my daughters has her tablet at her other mom\u2019s house. I loved that I could specify that her tablet was there. Now when I call emergency services (well, I hope never to call), they\u2019ll know where we are if we use one of our Amazon devices. Way too cool!Overall, the sound is better, it has more features, and I really love that I was able to link in calling out on my Amazon devices via my AT&T account. I absolutely love that feature.Better sound is great, too, because I listen to music a lot. The sound is just richer and more detailed. No, this isn\u2019t a Bang and Olufsen, but it sure sounds nice.One caveat. The light ring is on the bottom, so if you have this on a crowded surface as I do, it\u2019s harder to see the light ring. If you have yours in a clear area, just ignore that. But for me, I preordered a wall mount. That will get the Echo raised to where we can see the light ring, and it will also clear the bit of space where I had it.Very pleased with this newest generation of Echo.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

After setting up the sub and now this second echo in a pairing configuration, know this:1. The speakers only play together when streaming content from the internet (Amazon music or if you have Apple Music linked to Alexa). If you try to pair your phone via Bluetooth and play, it will ONLY play through the single echo (no sub, no second echo)2. Pairing trick - immediately after setting up my sub or 2nd echo, I could not for the life of me, pair them to my existing echo. Apparently, you have to wait about 5-10mins before you can pair them together. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s some discovery process so they can see each other on the local network. So if at first you can\u2019t pair them, come back in 10 mins and try again.Otherwise, the sound is quite good for such a small speaker and I love the motion detection feature for automation.Hope this helps someone!\n",15 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

The sound quality was great but I would have liked more bass especially for the cost. But for some reason the Alexa voice control didn't work that great I often had to ask several times for it to get it right so I took it back.  I originally wanted the Echo Studio but it's not been available for months now so I decided to get this Echo Premium sound.  When I first hooked it up in the living room on an end table I honestly was not impressed and was going to take that one back as well.  But!  I wanted to listen to music in the bathroom so I hooked it up in there and wow- it sounded like a different speaker all together it was sitting higher than it was on the living room end table and was also in a corner those two details transformed the sound.  It's sound quality is on par but just slightly under the Sonos One @ $220 but when you think of the big price difference it makes the Sonos not worth the price.  If you had $200 to spend on speaker I would buy two of the Echo 4 Premium sound speakers that makes a stereo pair and for sure would sound better than one Sonos One. I always thought the Echo Studio would be closer paired to the Sonos but I think it's actually closer to the Echo 4 Premium. Another reason that I like it better is you can play music through out your house on any Echo devices.  With the Sonos it has to be another Sonos product to play throughout house.  In my bedroom I have an Echo dot that is connected to my very favorite Logitech Z625 400 watt 2.1 THX certified speakers so I can still get the bass from the subwoofer in the bathroom that makes the Echo sound that much better.  I'm glad I gave it a chance before returning.  Another tip is make sure you set the equalizer to your liking adjusting that makes a huge difference.\n,,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Let's see if they do something to fix this or if they are now going to make you buy the next Generation and this purchase was a pretty much a waste of money.

The sound quality was really good compared to previous echo devices that I still have. You can tell that the sound is actually more premium like the title states. The bass is deeper along with other things and at a high volume this device doesn\u2019t get sloppy. I keep it in my living room to play music and announce motion on my Blink cameras.

So for prime day i jumped on this and wow \U0001f929 the difference between the echo dot and this Echo is astronomical.The Echo Dot surprised me with how much bass it has for the size of the speaker. This echo blows me away The bass sounds clear and surprisingly strong for such a little speaker. Honestly, I feel like it would put some of my bookshelf speakers to shame that cost just as much or more and require a separate amplifier for power.I really feel like the biggest drawback is the microphone\u2026 No I\u2019m not saying it is any worse than the echo dot but it certainly isn\u2019t better. Sometimes I feel like you can\u2019t hear me as I scream, Alexaaaaa! and other times it will randomly pop up as I\u2019m whispering something similar.Overall, especially if you get it on a deal this is a fantastic Speaker. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in having higher Fidelity audio, but doesn\u2019t want to jump for an audio file system. Bang for buck I don\u2019t think that you can do much better than the echo. I\u2019m very much considering getting a second possibly third or fourth.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I got 2 Echo\u2019 4thgeneration devices. To me, the sound on the 4th generation echo compared to the full size prior cylinders is worse to me. The 4th generation echo send the sound out mainly in 1 direction. The cylinders sent it out all around.The 4th generation echo comes with a short power cord. Went and got a power cord extender to be able to plug it in. That is a minusThe 4th generation echo doesn\u2019t pick up my voice as well. This is probably because of the fact it only has 4 microphones and not 7. MinusThe buttons Arrangement on the 4th generation echo is different then the prior echo cylinders along with the prior dot\u2019s. The older echo have the Volume up at 12 (Side of power cord coming out), Echo button at 3, Volume down at 6 and Microphone button at 9. The 4th generation echo has the Echo button at 12, Volume up at 3, Microphone at 6 and volume down at 9.Speaking of volume! This 4th generation echo as far as the Alexa voice isn\u2019t as loud. It is at least 1 full volume step lower. Example, the prior cylinder at volume 6, I need to have the 4th generation echo at least at volume 7 for the same Alexa voice volume. MinusIn testing.1. Temperature The 4th generation echo hub will go below 32F. Plus.2. Echo 4th generation echo built in temperature is a lot closer. plus3. Echo 4th generation echo will not read battery status of sensors or humidity. No improvement.4. If you have a lot of sensors/bulbs connected on an Echo ZigBee hub. If you leave it plugged in, things will work OK. Otherwise if you want to move them over to the Echo 4th generation Echo, you\u2019ll need to go through a lot of steps for each device.5. If you unplug the Echo 4th generation and plug it back in, you have to wait for it to recalibrate the temperature sensor 45 minutes to 60 minutes. Minus.6. I\u2019ve had the Echo 4th generation just stop responding and had no audio output at all. I\u2019ve had this happen at least 2 times within the last 7 weeks. Had to unplug the echo and plug it back in to get Audio back. The Echo showed online, I could do drop in to it from other devices in the house, I could tell one of my other echo\u2019s in the house to set volume to 10 on the 4th generation echo and none of that caused audio to come back. The only thing that get the Audio back was unplugging and plugging it back in. Minus7. Sensor/light ZigBee testing echo 4th generation hub. All sensors/lights worked accept for an older plug that I had to use the Alexa App to get it online being the 4th generation echo thought it was an bulb when I did a scan for new devices. minus8. If you connect an Bluetooth headset to the Echo 4th Generation, the echo doesn\u2019t use the microphone on the headset! It only uses the microphones on the unit itself. No improvement9. If you are using an Bluetooth headset and you have Follow-up mode turned on for that Echo, the Follow-up mode doesn\u2019t work at all when using the Bluetooth headset. If you ask the Echo to turn on Follow-up mode, it will tell you it isn\u2019t supported. No improvement10. If you have a fan blowing on the echo or over the echo! This will make the temperature way off! This is true for the Echo 4th generation. No improvementIf you have an old Echo dot! Then you will find a large improvement in the 4th generation echo over a DOT of any type.If you don\u2019t have a echo at all or you are wanting to see what the smart home automation is about and are willing to deal with a very basic ZigBee hub! Then this may be for you.If you have other question; Post them and if I find them and can help I will.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I did finally get them working (a few days later they sit magically realized they\u2019re on the same network). They sounds great. Bumped it from 2 to 4 stars. Would give 5 if it weren\u2019t for the below time wasting activity.I bought these to replace a 2nd gen Echo set.  I had lots of issues with the 2nd gen in stereo + sub mode.  Mostly related to the setup (next paragraph).  Usually if you can get them setup, they work mostly ok.  Every few hours one of them will start to just play static...which is more than moderately annoying.  Most of the time this can be fixed by saying Alexa, Stop and then Alexa play...  About 1/6 times it requires physically unplugging all three devices and then plugging them back in.  About 1/30 times they have to be unpaired and re-paired and that leads to the below nerdspeak.Setup: So we have a home network with multiple SSIDs overlaid on 3 Unifi-Pro-AC Access Points (highly recommend those btw).  However, every time I try to create a stereo + sub pair, once I click on the L or R speaker it tells me the R or L speaker is on a different wifi network (it isn't, all our IoT spyware devices are on one SSID/VLAN).  So I thought maybe I'll just disable all but the closest AP and turn on only 2.4GHz.  Note: this meant I had to drop like 50 other wireless clients, but I still did it, still got the same faux error.  Why I know this is an Amazon issue (and suspect it's the Alexa app specifically) is because the sub will pair just fine with either echo.  But yet the echos won't pair with each other.  Then days later, I looked again, and viola it let me pair them again.I googled for help, but all I found was a bunch of other users with the same issue but no resolution.  So I contacted Amazon, which was a waste of time.These may be fine speakers on their own, but if you plan to pair them in a stereo or stereo + sub set you're as likely as I was to be disappointed.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I've owned an 3rd gen echo dot for several years and just really wasn't thrilled about the muffled sounding voice of Alexa. I used the Dot in my living room but preferred the voice of another assistant as it was clearer and more crisp sounding with speech when asking about the weather or the news etc. The 3rd gen Dot was just ok for playing music. I watched videos on the new 4th gen Echo and they all raved about the bass and the loudness the 4th Gen Echo could produced. I will have to say it really surprised me how much bass and power it has. It is great for listening to music. The one downside I have found  is that the microphones seem to be on the weak side when I ask it to play a song or ask it a question. I have to be within 6 feet of the Echo for it to correctly hear what I am asking it to do. The 3rd gen echo dot I have can hear me from another room. I am not sure what is up with the microphones. I also have other assistants and they have no problem at all of hearing every word I speak. Seems to be a problem with the Echo.Another kind of annoying thing with the Echo is the WHITE POWER CORD. My Echo is Black and the white cord sticks out like a sore thumb. The Echo sits on my night stand and it just looks completely odd to see this black cloth covered ball sitting there with this bright white cord sticking out. And no i am not taking a black magic marker and coloring the cord as I have seen in other comments. MY 3rd gen echo dot at least came with a black power cord. My Echo Show 8 came with a black power cord. So for a $100.00 you would think they could color match the power cord to the product. They have done it with past products.It's great for playing music but I use my other assistants to control lighting etc. It's a $100.00 speaker for me.\n,,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

The idea of cute spheres I could mount on my walls was super appealing, so I got the maximum quantity and mounted them using a cute white stand.That\u2019s about where my excitement around these new speakers ended. Every Alexa model has a few quirks here and there, but these things specifically are actual trash. The number of artifacts during playback is insane, frequent, and every one of them is obnoxious. They wake me up in the middle of the night frequently with their BS, I\u2019m about to rip them off the walls and through them out the window.Examples:-This morning I got woken up super early by a crackle that can only be called \u201cfireworks\u201d playing on top of sleep sounds out 2 of my speakers.-every single time I\u2019m playing music or sleep sounds and ask Alexa to lower or raise the volume she\u2019ll do it at first and then goes into stutter mode rapidly turning the audio on and off in all speakers, or fading the sound in and out rapidly. Every time I use my voice to change the volume I have to stop and restart my music.-Sometimes Alexa decides to just not change the volume on voice command at all, regardless of which phrase you use to ask her to. Sometimes you ask her to do \u201cvolume 3\u201d and she\u2019ll play 3 everywhere except one room where she plays volume 10 and you jump up screaming \u201cAlexa Stop\u201d before your eardrums burst but she apparently can\u2019t hear you over the noise she\u2019s making and so you have to run to another room and scream at a different Alexa to get her to stop and then manually adjust the volume for that one speaker in the app-often not all speakers in a group or room will play together even if they show as grouped in the app and you select that specific group for playback. There are two ways to fix this, remove and re-add the offending speaker, or send music to that speaker solo for a minute and then try the group again.-Randomly the speakers produce really loud constant static. So you\u2019ll have multiple speakers playing music in a group and suddenly one will go static and the only way I\u2019ve found to get it working again is to unplug it, wait a few minutes, and plug it back in.-in general the speakers are not consistent in sound quality, the music sounds slightly more tinny in one, more rich in another, more base heavy in another\u2026it\u2019s slightly noticeable with music if you switch the one that\u2019s playing back and forth to hear the sound quality differences\u2026 but where it\u2019s really obvious is with sleep sounds, frogs will sound higher in one, deeper in another, and like possessed demon frogs in a third.  One of the speakers plays sleep sounds at double speed and I\u2019ve not found a way to fix it. For that one music is sometimes normal and sometimes double speed.-occasionally an actual demon from hell talks over my speakers and during the Covid lockdown I for sure thought I was going crazy. Occasionally a male or female voice will just talk through my speakers briefly, one or two words, and then nothing for a few weeks till suddenly in the middle of the night someone talks out my speakers again. I got paranoid and put them on their own dedicated WiFi channel and super protected it with a random 32-character password, I monitor my network traffic and access, and even still sometimes these things will pick up or play a person talking randomly.Since I bought these speakers there has not been a single day where I haven\u2019t had to try various workarounds to get them to function.

Greenlee,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on December 25, 2020","A nice addition to my ""smart"" home","\nWe had two sets of Monster bluetooth speakers and all four connected to each other via 5.8hz technology. We'd run them through one Echo Dot, and that's how we did whole-house sound. But the Monster speakers are dying after a long life, and we needed to do something else. In my experience, using bluetooth speakers in tandem with Echo speakers throws the sound out of synch. So, I went for an all-Amazon solution.We already had three 3rd-gen Dots, a Spot, a Fire Cube 4K, FireTV and a Show 5. So, I bought this new 4th-gen Echo to be the ""hub"" of things, plugged it in, and bada-bing, it set itself up. I added all of the speakers (except the Fire Cube) to the ""everything"" music group, and it works pretty darn well. You can tell it to play anything on ""everywhere."" You can tell it to turn the sound level to maximum ""everywhere.""  It's mostly fixed my problem with replacing my old speakers. Now, some things I learned:- Echo Show 5 has only two mics, and they're terrible. Put that in a room that is away from the rest, where there isn't any overlap.- Echo Spot gets very confused when connected to the old bluetooth speakers, and would oddly slow down Alexa's speech, and song speeds. Don't ask me how, but it did. But the old speakers are out of the equation now.- Fire Cube 4K will not join the ""everything"" sound group, but also isn't a terribly good speaker, so it's not a loss.- To have more robust sound, we kept an EchoDot in the same room with the new 4th-gen Echo, but changed its wake-word to ""Echo,"" to avoid confusion between them.- Fire Cube 4K's wake word was changed to ""computer"" for the same reason.- Echo 4th-gen is great in most respects, but may have slightly less responsive mics. I've had her wake, but then ignore my requests. It's a minor issue, and nowhere near as bad as the EchoShow 5.All-in-all, I'm pretty happy with the purchase, with my primary mission--whole house sound--solved. I figure I'll replace a Dot or two with these or other Echo speakers with more robust sounds as the months and years go by. I'll keep watching for sales. I got this one for 69.95, and it was very much worth it.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

I plugged it into the wall, the echo was detected by previously installed Alexa devices and it was all set up with a confirmation. Device is updated with a new processor which is supposed to improve the speed of response and commands.Pros:The addition of another tweeter to the new 4th Gen now fills the room with even more sound and provides more volume than previous generations.Sound mapping improves the sound quality based on room size and shape features.Temperature sensor now allows for more routine customization.Home theater setup: I currently have two of these paired with an echo sub to create a home theater 2.1 system through my Fire TV Cube.Internal Zigbee hub allows for a more integrated smart home experience, helps to lessen the bandwidth requirements of a smart home and improves the range for connected compatible devices through a Zigbee mesh network. (This is a largely desired improvement)Cons:Home theater setup: Despite having two Echo\u2019s paired, the volume does not seem to be twice as loud as one would expect. It seems as though the audio levels are capped when the devices are connected in a home theater setup. While the volume is still good for the 2.1 system and it fills the room, it doesn\u2019t seem to be far different than running one Echo at upper level volume. Also not capable of providing Dolby Atmos surround sound with Echo Gen. 4 as the paired speakers (Echo Studio required for this).While there is only one con on my list it is a fairly large con as I purchased two of these devices in order to build a quality home theater system.

Figured it was worth a shot to see just how much better these were versus my Echo 3rd gens.I have them connected to a Firetv cube with an Echo sub as well (same configuration as was with my 3rd gen Echos).So the sound quality is slightly better. Not really that superior to the 3rd gens. The system as a whole may have  a little more bass but, I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s enough difference to warrant the extra $$$.Thare they really fall short is volume level. They seem to be quiet. With any background the sound of these just gets swallowed up.I would expect some real leaps and bounds from a \u201c4th\u201d gen speaker. These aren\u2019t it.The home hub is okay if you have specific hardware that requires a \u201chub\u201d but as of this post with over 50 \u201csmart\u201d devices in my home to include a thermostat, I\u2019ve yet to need a \u201chub\u201d. I feel it\u2019s just more \u201cfluff\u201d and gee wiz gadgetry that\u2019s unneeded.Also, I feel it\u2019s time (especially with the Firetv cube) to incorporate a true home theater so one can set this up with 4 speakers. The cube could be the center speaker in a 5.1 or 5.2 setup. Give the speakers a little more volume and then we\u2019d have something to write about.All in all, not that impressive.

It is indeed sending different signals to the left and right channels based on the music.I think it is pretty good for a home office. I did hear the Studio in the big box store last week and still might add one of those.Update: I would give 4.5 vs.perhaps a 3.8 earlier. It seems to adapt over time by perhaps learning your voice and acoustics as I moved it in the room.I had some credits with Amazon and decided to get this as it was on sale for $80- 25% trade in minus $5 dot trade in. So ~ $55 net. I was considering just getting a Echo Studio but the purpose of this is to sit on my floor and  sometimes listen to music during the work day.  My main Amazon/Alexa music listening to these days is through my Yamaha YAS109 and sometimes my Sonos One.The setup was easy, much better than years ago - just opened the app and it connected. No more, password, pressing two buttons at once.  I would agree that there have been a few ocassions I needed to repeat myself though as others have mentioned.I was surprised by how much bass there was- I am in the process of adjusting the EQ on the app. I have tried it out with some classic rock and disco.  I don't think the unit is earth shattering but for a casual listening experience while playing softly while WFH I think this has a lot of potential.I will see if repositioning it changes my opinion higher. I have a Echo Studio 5- i think this does have clearer vocals .UPDATE: It is sounding better maybe it does recognize the room/small area with my voice.I A/B'd it compared to my Sonos One and obviously one sonos one might sound better but this is decent i can even hear it in the next room where I am writing this.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

In fact, because of this one, (which I used to replace my 3rd Gen dot in my living room) I also decided to replace my dot in the bathroom as well!! I love the quality of sound, the much needed bass addition (for those of us with the echo Show 10, you know what I\u2019m talking about), and the fact that it looks and feel like it was made well! Aside from usual things that comes with having Alexa assist you, you also get a much needed room temperature that is also integrated. This is important because if you have it in your living room and your living room isn\u2019t where your home thermostat is, you can use this echo to determine what happens next with your ac or ceiling fans (provided you also have those things \u201csmart-ified\u201d!!!)! I wasn\u2019t expecting this added feature to be the best feature I didn\u2019t know I needed but glad it was there to show me what was needed to help me run my house more efficiently. The only thing this thing need (and I really hope Amazon will see and think about this) is \u201cmultiple command\u201d! For example, I should be able to say, \u201cAlexa, set kitchen light to 10%, kitchen light 1 and 3 to blue, kitchen light 2 and 4 to gold\u201d or \u201cset living room ceiling fan 1 and 2 to 3\u201d (I have multiple smart fans and lights) and she do it and say \u201cok\u201d. But that\u2019s not on the echo, that\u2019s on the software\u2026 but, it would definitely make it the ultimate upgrade for us die hard smart home fans!!!

I purchased the Echo for music while showering.  I'm impressed enough to write this review.  Now, if AMAZON considered reasonable trade-in values for older Echo Dots, I'd consider upgrading all the Dots I have around the house.  This Echo makes me wonder what the Echo Studio sounds like, but I can't bring myself to purchase an Echo Studio due to its cost; I also don't need one because my ""main music room"" has all the gear I need there.UPDATE:I had more than four (4) 2nd-generation DOTs, and tried the ECHO 4th-gen to replace my bathroom DOT for showers.  It works great in there, so I was moved to give the ECHO 4th-gen a positive review and went on to replace four (4) of my 2nd-gen DOTs with the 4th-gen ECHO.  First of all, these ECHO 4th-gens are very sensitive to position in terms of the sound.  I tolerated it.  (They sound much better than the DOTs.)  The MAIN PROBLEM with the ECHO 4th-gen is it DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO LISTEN.  Sometimes the one in the living room didn't even acknowledge I was talking to it!  (You can tell by the light not coming on.)  And oftentimes it wouldn't hear me, and another ECHO or DOT would answer!  So sometimes it wouldn't listen; other times it got the meaning of the words wrong; and yet other times it couldn't negotiate with the other ECHOs and DOTs ""within earshot"" as to which device should respond!  If this ECHO was defective, then all of them are defective: they all do the same goofed-up-listening thing.  I have since replaced the living-room ECHO 4th-gen with the old 2nd-gen DOT.  Now I have sane listening in my living room again.  I ""complained"" to AMAZON (oh how I complained) via ""I have feedback"" of course to no avail: AMAZON would have to acknowledge their design goof, which they continue to sell ""as is.""  There is something wrong with the voice pickup in these 4th-gen ECHOs.  It was aggravating enough for me to ""downgrade"" the 4th-gen ECHO to a 2nd-gen DOT.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

They need WiFi and the Alexa App to pair them.Amazon Music App works well and if you have the Formation, Apple Music and Tidal skills installed in the Amazon Alexa App you can figure out how to tell Alexa to play music from any skill source to any Alexa sound room or Formation sound stage.I will test them with WiFi off to see it it\u2019s possible to set them up and pair them using only Bluetooth and the iPhone Apps to see if I can get AirPlay to stream Bluetooth from Apple and Tidal music Apps to both Echo\u2019s as a pair. I swear my initial setup outside on the deck had my Airplaying to both speakers in stereo. The next day, my iPhone rejected the saved Bluetooth device and when I detected and reattached I was able to connect to each speaker one at a time with no way to hear stereo mode without Amazon Music or telling Alexa via WiFi.How they seemed to work via Airplay outside Amazon Music/Alexa on Bluetooth then wouldn\u2019t the next day is a mystery.Then how my Amazon Music App seemed to be broken with no way of changing speakers and other quirky things suddenly got better after I agreed to purchase Music HD is another mystery.

Actually liked it so much that the second one arrived and was installed today. Overall we like this latest gen. Both replaced units were gen 2 echos and it was time. You could tell she\u2019s just tired. But they\u2019re willing to give me $30 each for the core, I\u2019m good.Been playing with the one for at least a week. I do see some differences with it that I\u2019m attributing to the placement of the mics etc. We both like the light on the bottom and the overall design. We haven\u2019t run into any of the problems I\u2019ve read in the feedback like low volume etc. I think part of that is now they have the capability to speak louder if they detect ambient noise. That seems to work fine but I found that the normal voice seems a little lower than I would like and had to bump up the volume by a tick. But really this is just about fine tuning and certainly nothing to have a coronary about! When it starts making calls to the Kremlin without my permission then I\u2019ll have a complaint! (Jk I hope). Oh one thing that I really love is that there is a temp sensor in the unit. Love that because I keep a close eye on my hvac system.

Speakers themselves are okay.,"\nI bought an Echo 4th gen and an Echo Dot (4th Gen) in a package.  I've been using them for 9 months now. These devices do play music from Amazon Prime Music account but the Alexa software is pretty buggy.  Example:  For months I couldn't get the two paired Echo devices to play Amazon music (or anything else) on Everywhere group.  Then recently I was able to get that to work, BUT Alexa would only play one song from Amazon music then shut all devices down.  I made sure network connectivity was not the problem. Both Echo devices  are paired and connected to the same wi-fi network.  My Everywhere Group includes both devices.  I could play music all day long on a single device at a time.  Today (9/29/2021) I found that if you start initially playing Amazon music on Everywhere, it will shut off all devices after one song, BUT, if you initially start playing NPR/Kuow (from iHeart Radio) on Everywhere, you can then switch to Amazon music and songs will continue to play.  This is what I mean by ""buggy"".Now for the rest.  The other Alexa features like Lists, Routines, Chore Chart (blueprint), Task Tracker (blueprint) are so far pretty useless.  What I wanted to do was use Alexa to help us  (two adults) manage our time, like keep track of chores, with daily reminders, and keep track of tasks lists for each of us.  Alexa doesn't seem to be able to use more than a single ""list""  or tracker and it better be for a single person.  I created two lists (using Lists & Notes, not Blueprints), one a shopping list, one a to-do list.  Alexa had trouble keeping these lists separated, and adding/removing items at least from voice commands.  I also tried creating a couple of Skills using Chore Chart blueprint and Task List blueprint.  These also did not work for multiple people, and you cannot edit the items without logging into the Blueprints web so it's not very useful for a daily Task List that needs to be dynamic.Bottom line, it has taken 9 months to get this far. I was willing to put some learning time in, but not have to take a class or hire a technician just to get things working.  I find the Echo hardware are adequate speakers for me, but Alexa software is not.  Amazon's online documentation is woefully inadequate, difficult to find and very general.  I did not try the Help & Feedback from the iOS Alexa app since I find reading documentation on a phone screen difficult.  The forums are sometimes helpful if you use suggestions cautiously.  I  have spent a lot of time trying to get Alexa features working, and my lack of success does not make me happy.  I admit my expectations may have been too high.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

It automatically connects to you iPhone if Alexa is running on both. Probably anything else that is Amazon or Apple and running a suitable version of the IOS. It (she) occasionally would like to wash my mouth out with soap. But, there have been no shopping sprees, or other misunderstandings. I have wanted to introduce her to a neighbor\u2019s version to see if I can get a conversation going. But, that\u2019s probable not too smart.  Her premium sound isn\u2019t terrible, but it isn\u2019t premium unless your standards don\u2019t ask for much.  Still that is not it\u2019s main function.  It delivers podcasts clearly, music acceptably and understand me well.  But, if you e pre y to get HD you will have to wait. I come from a time when it had to be big to sound good. That was not all it had to be, that was the minimum. That era has been eclipsed by amazingly small drivers that produce very fine music. Give Amazon some time and they may get there.

Using it as a smart hub has given me zero issues as well.  If I had one complaint, it would be that Alexa seems to be getting hard of hearing and will sometimes require multiple prompts.

Until now. Purchased this because I could not find a Bluetooth speaker to work with my tv that wasn't overly expensive.  I like the sphere shape and it is a slightly heavy solid device (drop it on your foot and it'll hurt) which speaks of quality construction.  Just set it up which would have been easy if I didn't have to track down the device settings that had all voice control stuff turned off. Amazing how cryptic some device ID'S are. You have to best guess a lot of times. Still, once that was straightened out it was easy. Having an Amazon account really did make things go smoother. Now, I can get enough volume with enough clarity to understand what the talking heads are saying. Setting the controls for Bass, Treble and Mids was easy. I appreciate the Bass control as it is physically painful if set too high. Since this is my first experience with this type of device I gave it only 3 stars until I have more experience with it. So far, it is performing well. Sound quality isn't quite as good as I'd hoped, but it is quite good and all I need so no complaints there. Only thing I wonder about is every time a commercial comes on with some idiot saying ""Alexa"" will the device think I wanted something.

As a speaker it's really nice the sound is much better than my older bose soundtouch systems and my Google speakers which is strange because it's so much smaller its hilarious ive found to embrace the size as an advantage and am getting used to it the up firing speaker placement seems to work better than forward firing and I feel it fill my room better than my previous speakers at a comparable volume.  The volume it self is crazy loud i don't see my self ever using it anywhere over 75% its nice to have the option to go that loud i guess but the volume controls are some what limited unless you resort to voice commands since the app is pretty laggy. The app is something that definitely needs work but thats expected it can be frustrating at times and I did have some issues durring set up where my speaker would lose connection with the app causing a longer than expected set up. I've also noticed lag when using the app to control music or audio books with the app sometimes crashing and causing the speaker to stop playing but I've only experienced this when using the alexa app and using the specific app like audible and amazon music and controlling it from there has been much smother. The voice commands work perfectly its much more responsive than my older generation Google speaker and I haven't had any times where it has misunderstood me or been unable to complete a voice command. Voice commands is where the echo really shines its so convenient and responsive with executing every task ive asked it whether controlling my fire tv, playing music, searching for specific information, and making calls has all worked flawlessly voice commands is by far the best way to control the echo. Overall I'm pretty pleased with my purchase changing eco system i was a bit concerned but ive had a mostly positive experience so far and am enjoying my new speaker.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

Improved features!,"\nI've owned 3 Echo Dot devices for around 2+ years.  Thought they were very handy and speedy enough for streaming music and accomplishing other things in a smart home.  They even work well to answer trivia questions should you have a curious mind wishing to learn about things.  Sound quality was ok but nothing to write home about.  Connecting them to a good quality Bluetooth speaker was the ticket.  I've found the best solution was to connect the external Bluetooth speaker to the Echo Dot with a 3.5 mm quality cable (if possible) and that would then leave the Bluetooth connection available for a phone or tablet.  Otherwise, you waste the cable audio input and defeat other features available through the Bluetooth Network connection to the Echo Dot.  I digress...The Echo 4th Gen has very respectable sound quality even at low volume.  The Alexa software with bass, midrange, and treble adjustments enable fine tuning of the sound quality.  The  3.5mm connection port is now both in and out.  Same thing for Bluetooth - in or out.  The WiFi capability is further enhanced with an upgrade to AC class so it can connect at 800 + megabit for streaming Hi-Res audio with no lag at all.  A bit overkill for audio only.  I imagine Amazon device engineers figured AC 5 Ghz would be necessary since it also has Higbee hub capabilities that may need lots of processing and the associated network bandwidth capabilities to other devices.  I could go on and on about this new Gen4 Echo.  At the current holiday sale price with free included options, it is a huge STEAL.  I've purchased 5 of these devices as Christmas presents.  4 of them with the 2 smart Hue Led lightbulbs and a fifth one to use as a stereo pair for a relative.  She is going to love the sound of it playing Amazon Music HD through that pair.  What a very nice inexpensive ""smart"" stereo.

What so many people don\u2019t mention is, if you\u2019re starting off to make your home a smart home, you\u2019ll maybe need a Bridge or Hub that can utilize Zigbee, Z-Power or Thread. Google Hub isn\u2019t actually a hub that can support those radios and the hubs can be about $50-$100 on their own. So Echo 4 comes with a hub to use for smart locks, bulbs, cameras, doorbells etc and it has Airplay!!Sound of the device is pretty amaze considering the price. Deep rich bass, nice highs and mids. No distortion. I had to put a grip to the bottom of the 4 because it would vibrate off the shelf if I didn\u2019t, but I was listening to VERY bass heavy music (Bassnectar)Set up was as easy as plugging it in and opening the app. I think that was it. Once it was set up the app let me know the 4 wanted to set up my lights and with a click, it set both of them up!Alexa routines are amazing for automation  Alexa, Good night  turns my lights off, activates my alarms, schedules my lights to gradually come on to a specific brightness gradually over a set time, tells me my appointments for tomorrow and the weather, tells me sweet Dreams, and plays sounds of rain.I haven\u2019t had to use the buttons on it yet. Voice works too well for me to need to press buttons yet.Drop in works very well and both the caller and I can hear one another near perfectlyEcho 4 and 3 aren\u2019t able to be paired together to make a stereo set, but you can use the 3 and 4 in the same house, group, room and they work like they should.Still reading up on the tons of things I can get automated now that I have a hub, smart speaker with airplay.

But it has some flaws.First it doesn\u2019t seem to have any switch for local voice control. So will the hub work when the internet isdown with my zigbee lights? My studios still control zigbee lights, but not sure if this one can. The newecho has trouble hearing me, but I think this is due to low power mode, as it has to recover before it canlisten. So I have to often repeat commands. The bass is nice and the sound is in one direction more likea normal speaker, but I got used to the 360 degree sound, so this seems a little backward to me. Thesound isn\u2019t bad just different. One thing I hate is the interaction with my bluetooth mesh alexa onlybulbs. If I tell it to turn on light 2, it always turns it on at 100% and white. This is different from mystudios which just turn on the light at the current settings. I keep the downstairs light blue and 5%, if Igo downstairs and say to my studio turn on light 2, it is blue and 5%, if I say turn on light 2 to the gen 4it turns on the light white at 100%.Overall it isn\u2019t bad, I will keep it, but I have the original echo in the closet just in case..\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

And as capable as it is, and as compatible with as many things as it is, they push software updates all the time.Excellent voice recognition, quicker than previous version.And the sound is MUCH better than previous generations.Don't let anyone tell you (like those you tube reviews) ""it is the same driver""> IT IS NOTWhat they mean is, ""it is the same diameter"". But there is SO much more to a speaker than just the diameter.The cone is lighter and stiffer, it has a die cast aluminum ""basket"" instead of a stamped sheet metal one. I haven't taken the speaker completely apart so I haven't checked the voice coil, but the magnet is also much heavier. The surround (annulus) seems more pliant.All this results in better sound.This model has two dome tweeters for slightly better mids and highs and better directionality in both mono and especially stereo modes.Of course it isn't a replacement for a home stereo, and it is was never meant to be. It's just meant to fill a room with sound when you're not critically listening.Another thing is that the new generation also is made out of mostly recycled parts.Of course Alexa is much better than siri and almost on par with goog when doing queries and she's getting better every day\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I found this to be a bit disappointing as I got used to the quality of the voice recognition and the previous version. the voice recognition quality appeared to degrade after an update. I do hope they fix this. The sound quality however is excellent.  I've been using it with basic Amazon music service and that's been more than enough for me. I have multiple devices so when I tell it to play music everywhere I hear music throughout my home playing simultaneously. It also connects to various podcasts and online radio stations.One feature that I do like is the built-in thermostat. I'm able to use that to trigger other  devices such as a portable heater, which are plugged into smart plugs, to turn off and on in a room when the temperature is above or below a certain range.The ability to call people through the device is that nice bonus.i It is not using your cell phone which I found to be a bit creepy but it will put your cell phone number as a number that is being dialed so it is effectively spoofing your phone. Basically you could put any phone number there in the account online  to be dialing from and it will use it.The user interface for Alexa integration is quite frankly confusing. I write computer systems for a living it took me quite a while to figure out the integration. I think the average user will give up on many of the integration features because of this difficulty. I should be able to talk to the device directly to create a routine and not be clicking through an application with confusing menus.Overall it's still a great piece of technology and I highly recommend it.\n",,

I can say its name and it does not respond, sometimes I will have to raised my voice to a yell for it to hear me which does not work well when others are sleeping.  Other times, my older generation device in my bedroom responds and there is a wall between me and it.  I am sitting aprx 8-10 ft away from the device and it does not hear!  Sometimes when I ask it for my notifications, the one in the bedroom answers me thru the wall which of course I can't hear the notification!

I am a big music/music quality person and these have made a massive difference. I rarely even use my JBL speaker now because the quality in these is actually even better than that!!i do wish there was sort of a travel option like most other bluetooth speakers, since sometimes i like to take them outside or to an area where plugs are not accessible. i wish there was a way around this that was not overly complicated or required purchasing another object.  Otherwise i would recommend to anyone who loves alexa products but was missing the sound quality of the dot.to summarize: for someone who is not super into music, the echo dot is a more ""appropriate"" size and music quality is good enough.for someone who appreciates/is into music: the echo is SO worth the investment. it is significantly bigger than the dot, but i dont find that it looks ridiculous, just takes some getting used to - because the bigger size is so worth the sound quality difference.\n",5 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Most of the time I wind up talking to the dot in the kitchen, though, because it hears me better, and only speak to the Echo when I want it to play music.That said, the sound quality is noticeably better with the bigger echo, especially when it comes to bass. The dot is good, especially for a casual listener like me, but if you want better bass the echo is a good option. In our little condo it's loud to me at volume 6/10 and we generally keep the volume at 3 or 4.It has a temperature sensor inside which is kinda fun but we don't have a smart thermostat so it's not a big selling point for me. I'm new to smart home stuff, so I haven't bothered figuring out the ZigBee thing yet.I bought it on Prime Day, and for what I paid then I'm content. If you already have a dot and you're just looking for better sound, though, it might be worth it to you to spend the extra on the Echo Studio. We don't have it but a relative does, and the sound out of that is really nice.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Of course it lacks true stereo separation, but that is hardly noticed with the 2 separate tweeters at 45 degree angle to each other.This is a great way to stream music in HD and UHD as Echo 4 plays in this cd-quality format, better than mp3 quality for sure.UPDATE: Voice recognition while loud music is playing is not as good as the 2nd generation, which is very sensitive during loud music or TV. With the TV at normal listening level, I have to almost yell to get the new Echo to hear what I am saying.My opinion is that this one is great for pop music, which doesn't require as great sound as, say, symphonic music. I listened to a Mahler symphony with this Echo and the sound quality was quite good, suitable for background listening to classical. My high fidelity Onkyo system and speakers of course sound better, and a high quality sound system is required for serious classical listening. Still, this is a good unit and replaces my 1st gen living room Echo. The comparison here is phenomenal.The new HD 2009 remastered Beatles albums sound great with Echo 4!Also, it works with non-Amazon music streamers though it requires a paid subscription to Amazon Music HD to access them!I like the globe-shape design. I was surprised at the white power cord, but it didn't bum me out like some reviewers here.It has a jack for a mini-plug that you can plug by wire into separate speakers, tho I haven't tried it.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

It doesn't work. The smart phone app is very difficult to follow in attempting to set up. After numerous attempts, this echo 4 simply sits on the shelf. I will probably return. Amazon customer service tech support is non existent. I have the echo 3 which works fine. This echo actually cannot handle the density of bits and bytes in a dense classical piece of music and audibly skips whole seconds of music because its small processor is weak. This is not an issue for the majority of buyers who listen to hip hop and the like. The echo 3 has no problem with this issue whatsoever. Amazon does not read or use these reviews, so it really doesn't matter, because amazon is so big, it could care less. I suspect that a it is rarely a good idea to buy electronics from amazon because most of it is knock offs and junk.Within 10 minutes of submit this review, I was stunned that an amazon tech employee called me out of the blue! I have to swallow my words now. This cheerful man helped me and within minutes the Echo 4 worked perfectly and was all set up!  Of course, Bezos (soon to be happily launched into space where he can stay) does give this kind of diligent employee, as well as others, the work conditions and th raises they need to make a living. I thank this man for his help. And, again, I take back everything, but for the skipping when there's too much music density such as an orchestra. It's true, Amazon doesn't always drop the ball.

This little wonder provides plenty of bass and rich tones to fill a room. What's more, its voice recognition is marvelous and I'm guessing the spherical shape of the unit has a lot to do with that. Even while playing music at high volume, it recognizes my commands. No need to shout over the music. (It's almost scary how well it hears, despite significant, competing sounds.)Connectivity to my Alexa SmartHome was quick and seamless. Easy-peasy. I recommend purchasing the recharging mount/stand, as shown in the pic and available here on Amazon. Simply unplug the AC cord after charging and the unit is portable/wireless anywhere within the home where WiFi is accessible--for up to five hours.All in all, the Echo 4th Gen exceeds my expectations. As for issues of privacy that have surrounded this device and others since their inception? There are a number of ways to protect yourself if you are concerned--ways that I won't delineate here. Do your settings homework and you'll see that Amazon can learn as little or as much about your household as you permit. As for me and mine? I employ a few such settings but I'm not paranoid about it. The benefits that the Alexa suite of products provide me far outweigh any concerns I might have about privacy intrusion. Again, take the time to learn about the product and configure your devices to suit your needs AND protect your family's information.

Needs hearing aids.,"\nSince wink has pretty much gone belly up and started charging to use it I decided it was time to put it to bed. Since I already have numerous dots, spots, and shows I decided the best idea was to go with the echo hub. I have a Phillips hue hub and numerous bulbs which connected very easily. I also have several switches that were mostly Z-wave so those all had to be replaced with Kasa zigbee switches which also installed very easily. My back door lock is a Schlage Connect but it was also Z-wave so I had to replace that with a Schlage Connect zigbee and that installed much easier than the Z-wave. I have to agree with everyone that it\u2019s ridiculous they ship a white power cable with a charcoal unit. Luckily my cable is mostly hidden. I thought I could possibly use a power cable from one of the old dots but they all work on different amp outputs. I also have to agree that this thing needs an improvement on it\u2019s microphone. I have this installed in my kitchen and normally have to call it my name several times to get it to respond whereas one of my shows is in the living room and I can easily get it to respond from the kitchen. Overall it was much easier to install and maintain than the wink hub. A word of advice. If you have a wink hub and you want to change to this hub make sure that you delete all of your devices from your wink app, unlink everything in the wink settings, remove the app from your phone and disable the wink skill. Otherwise Alexa Will reinstall them automatically and you will have to delete them all every time it does. Speaking from experience.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

You most likely had those set up as your ""main"" echo device and didnt bother to reset it to this ""new"" device. You have to assign the new echo as the main one. The device can hear you just fine, but you still have your previous device set as the speaker used to answer.Read the tutorials to best set up your device for multiple rooms because 9 out of 10 times youve missed a step.with that said this device soundS PHENOMENAL. Its no surround sound system and wont replace a stereo system (but could if you buy 2 echos plus a subwoofer and link them all into a right and left +sub audio stereo system!!) but it sounds better than any of the top of the line bluetooth devices I have. the bass is great, the mids are spot on and the trebles/highs are great. You can set them to your liking if youre not happy with any or prefer a different sound but in my opinion the sounds is fantastic.Ive had no issues with her recognizing my voice, I did however suffer the issue above (she would respond on my older speakers) but once i figured out how to reset up my rooms its all perfect now.I havent gotten a chance to use the zigbee hib only because i already have two other hubs set up and im too lazy to to restart everything under zigbee since its all working fine with my hue a gosund apps, maybe some day.Id recommend this over the dot or older echo any day of the week\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

There is no question that this is an upgrade from the prior version.I think the sound quality is great. Have you gone in to the Alexa app and individually adjusted the audio settings for the device? You can adjust the bass, treble, and mid range within the app, similar to how you would do so on your car radio; I\u2019m wondering if those that have commented so negatively about the sound quality knew or did that.Admittedly, I thought the sound was too bass heavy at first. Went in to the settings, and naturally each of the three audio settings were at zero, so I bumped the mid range and treble all most all the way up, and the bass just one more mark. Really evened out the sound, and I got to dancing quicklike. I take that as a good omen though that I thought it was bass heavy when the setting was on zero (it was just that the treble and midrange were too).  Seems to speak the quality of the small sub in there.  And I haven\u2019t noticed much difference, if any yet regarding the direct sound vs prior 360 sound. Pretty room filling still. I\u2019m looking forward to testing it out with the fire cube eventually.Setup was seemless, even rearranging three other, older devices and getting \u201cplay everywhere\u201d set back up.

It ends up being a real nightmare. thing start out ok.

More times than not you have to repeat command 3,4 or 5 times. also alexa will say she is having trouble connecting to the internet . the system keeps deleting smart plugs and light bulbs. and you will be on the phone a lot reporting problems and they will have you unplugging , restarting and doing a whole re-set up of all the devices. and nothing correct the problems.

Having the illuminated ring at the bottom where you cannot see it is just dumb, unless you have it on a glass shelf above head height.  Concerning Echo/Alexa in general, I cannot believe they have not made it any smarter in all these years.  Instead, they are putting all their energy into marketing gimmicks.  If I say the exact name of a song I want to hear, sometimes it will choose one with a similar name rather than the exact title I requested.  Stop doing what you think I want and start doing exactly what I say.  You should only play an alternative if I stated a title that does not exist or was not stated correctly.  I get ""Hmmm, I dont know the answer to that"" to some pretty simple questions as well.  They have it evolved to the knowledgeability of a nine year old and have not evolved it since.  I may begin to look at alternatives, as I cannot support this stupidity much longer.  In large companies, Marketing typically always has the power over Engineering.  I know this, as I am a retired Engineer from a large fortune 50 company.  It is apparent that Amazon is the same way.  I can hear the debate now... ""It won't work as well that way.

They (the dots) work alright but she (Alexa) can't hear me over music playing on medium and sometimes her own voice. The sound was ok but left a lot of room for improvement. So I got 2 of these. I love love love them. I can be playing music at full blast and I don't even have to raise my voice for her to hear me. Now I gave 4 out of 5 stars for sound quality as though it's really good it still leaves room for improvement.  I am a music junkie. I play it in the shower, as I'm getting ready, cooking, cleaning, everything. As this thing has a tiny sub in it, I was expecting more bass. But other then that it's great.  So loud no one can hear my crappy voice as I sing a long. It goes so loud that in a regular voice I can't hear myself, yet she can still hear me every time.

But I wanted a Gen 3 that . . .,"\n. . . seems to have been wiped from the face of the Earth.I read the specs and thought ""why not"". So I was having problems with my Gen 2, had a conversation with Tech Support and they said that the Gen 4 was many steps ahead in many of the problem areas that I was having. SO, I traded it in (big mistake), Gen 2 and got a good price on the Gen 4. But it turned out to be the ""Alexa System"" itself and still is. I still have the same problems. If not more as things seem to be degrading. And the design of the Gen 4 doesn't help at all with salient interaction. But now I have them with the inadequacies of the Gen 4 Bowling Ball. (Whomever thought of that should be . . . )As with all the other features, they're over hyped. Including the ones that they are releasing as if it's the 12 Days of Christmas. I have too much Bass even though I have backed it off in the settings. The device rattles as if there is ""FUD"" in the speaker cavity and rattles every thing that is in the vicinity. It also distorts easily and there seems to be no common volume settings/volume leveling, I know there are settings, they don't work, across all systems that provide material. The volume seems to be doing it's own thing. I've seen this said in a couple places. Even the ""Adaptive Listening"" is the epitome of wonky. It seems to operate just the opposite for what they say. I get all my music and podcasts lower than ""She who shall not be named"" and when ""She"" chimes in, it's blaring! The ""Increased User Vocal Sensitivity Pickup"" is nothing like they profess or the Gen 2 was. I have found, so has my family, that I have yell to get it to hear me. And repeat myself a lot!! The way it's designed it has a ""Front"" that you have to be inline with or it doesn't work right. ""What happened to the guy that created this thing?!"" The Gen 2 responded to a normal talking level from 360\xb0. ""She"" was just dumb. As they all are. The new ""Infra-Red Motion Sensing"" says that it's calibrated so that it reads things in a normal manner to avoid natural and not intentional movement. So it'll see a person when it's necessary and operate appropriately. ""So your don't have to wave your arms around in front of it"". YES YOU DO!AND with all this volume adjusting using the buttons on the top, HOW IN THE HECK DO YOU KEEP IT CLEAN?!!! I had though of putting it in a bowling ball cleaner at the lanes, but . . .There's so much just pain wrong with the whole situation in the first place that only make a half-arsed device, even more half-arseder. My Routines are no longer working completely. Sometimes they will completely fire off, to my surprise. But mostly not. Will fire off bit and pieces of a Routine if it cares. I'm having a heck of a time getting some devices to connect and once they are ""She"" snarfs them up and it's like having Double Natting in a Router. Other times I won't even be done and ""She"" says she sees it already and I haven't named it yet, so there's more work to make it right. And it doesn't always work.Oh! I have changed the voice over to the ""Male"" voice so I don't feel as bad cussing at it. But ""He's"" still dumb. Just like the ""pre-Demon"" Hemsworth in the ""Female"" version of ""GhostBusters"".Not sure what they are up to . . . I don't think they are either . . .\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

For example, when I stop music, there is a \u201ccrack\u201d sound, as if someone pulled the plug on the speaker, rather than a clean power down.

Compared to even the Gen 1 Echo Dot, its comprehension of what you're saying or ability to even hear you on the first try is not nearly as good.  Our old Echo Dot could hear us well from the other room, this one doesn't hear us on the first try 60% of time - from only a few feet way!  I've had enough experience with family members' earlier gen Echos to know this device is also inferior to them.The ball shaped, cloth coating gets dirty VERY quickly in a kitchen environment.****November 24, 2020****I purchased this Echo due to its ability to connect with Philips Hue bulbs without a hub.  The product is new enough that Amazon tech support does not understand that the Echo 4th generation does not work with Philips Hue bulb model LWB004. I have 2 of them and spent way too long on the phone trying to sort it out.  I ended returning my new Echo and getting again with a bundle of 2 new Hue bulbs (Model 453100).  Those Hue bulbs worked immediately and easily.The sound quality is is a step back from the the previous Echo models.  Definitely distortion on the maximum volume that is not there in older models.The size and shape are not as problematic as I thought it would be.  It does feel like it will be prone to getting damaged by kids more than the older coffee can version of the Echo design.In the end though, it is still cheaper than an Echo Dot plus a Philips Hue Hub.  And the Echo 4th gen certainly sounds better than an Echo Dot.  Additionally,  I am one of the people who got burned by Philips shutting off access to the first generation Hub, so I am happy to not be forced into buying another Hub from them.The sound quality is is a step back from the the previous Echo models.

We've been very leery about getting one due to what we've heard on the news, etc. Who wants a listening device in the privacy of their home when hackers can hack into them. Not that I feel they are completely safe now but will trust that Amazon will continue to protect us the best they can. After watching a friend use a different brand, it was totally helpful while baking cookies over Christmas, having the gadget set timers galore by just speaking. That sold it for me. lol.So far I like all that I've done with it except the issue my partner has getting Alexa to listen. Setting timers with no response back is frustrating. Then you feel like you have to yell. Though I never have issues when I speak to her. Not sure why it has difficulties listening to one person but not another. I wondered in the beginning if she had hearing troubles if other noises were happening around her or nearby.Anyway I am still excited to try everything else out. Kind of wanna get the bulbs now and a security camera. lol.I purchased two of them and found we really only needed one. But Amazon is making be pay for shipping or I have to find a UPS store for it to be free to send back. I felt that was kind of unfair. We have drop off places that are convenient but not any actual stores. So I rather not lose money by having to pay to return. Who knows maybe having two will eventually come in handy.

Other Echos I have are a 1st Gen Echo, a 1st gen Dot and a Show 5.I purchased the Gen 4 to replace my really early (pre-release/invite-ony) Gen 1 Echo. The Gen 1 still works fine and has been moved to another room. After a couple of hiccups setting up, the Gen 4 seems to be working fine. I had to reboot/reset it a couple of times to get the temperature sensor to calibrate, and I had to add/remove it from a group several times to get Guard to work.Pros: Obviously the addition of a Zigbee Hub is nice and the temperature sensor will be handy when I start upgrading my home thermostats to ""smart"" units. The Gen 4 seems to understand my commands more consistently and from greater distance. The audio quality is much improved over the Gen 1, even at low volume, especially the bass response.  Unfortunately, the bass gets a bit ""muddy"" at higher volume.Cons: I miss the volume twist-ring of the gen 1 and while the light ring at the bottom of the Gen 4  orb gives more of an ambient glow when activated, the top-mounted ring was more visible. The diameter of the orb is nearly twice the diameter of the cylinder, so it may affect placement for some people. Oh, and the power cord -- not only is it WHITE on a Charcoal colored device, but it is too short -- at least a foot shorter than the Gen 1 cord. (and they're not interchangeable.)Overall, I'm pleased with the new Echo, especially for the current (Dec 2020) sale price. It's worth the upgrade from an early Echo maybe not so much from an later one.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

My wife and i have an earlier echo generation and love it.  In my grandmother's case she loves the music, and help with reminders.  The problem arose during setup.  To create an account for my grandmother's echo it was required she had an email address.  She is 98 and does not use the internet nor has an email account.  So i elected to include it with my account.  All was good until we found out only one device could stream Amazon Music at a time.  My grandmother's Echo came with a promotional 6 month Amazon Music Premium feature while my wife and i only use the free Amazon Music with our Prime Account.  Suddenly, it became almost a competition where our echo would play one song then request if wanted to move the streaming service to our device.  We would have it and then lose it as my Grandmother at her location did the same thing.  I called Amazon about the problem and spoke with someone with a heavy Indian accent who claimed they could resolve the problem and after 20 minutes dropped the call.  I tried again and got a second Indian representative who was brash, rude, continually talking over me and saying ""just let your 98 year old Grandmother listen to her music!"".  Giving up i tried to politely end the call, where the representative asked if there was anything else he could help with.....  I was hoping i would get a survey about the call, but instead i got an form email from the rep saying it was a pleasure talking with me and he was glad he could help....  No survey.  On the same day this conversation occurred my wife got a charge on her credit card from Amazon for a Prime Membership.  When checking the credit card purchase online i clicked on the merchant who charged her and i was taken to my Amazon Prime Account.....  I did  not purchase a second Prime account and most assuredly not on my wife's credit card.  Well we got that charge cancelled but are still wondering what happened and are living with the competing Echo's.  Yet to be figured out.  The device is very nice....

I have six echos in my house.  included in these isn are a  Echo 1t Gen and the Echo 2nd Gen, which were the two I was considering upgrading.

Sound quality with respect to comparing with the previous echos.  Now that I've had them, (I bought two), for a few days, I am prepared to respond to those comments.1.  White power Cord - Who cares?  It works and isn't an eye sore.  If it bothers you maybe you can take a Sharpie and color it black.2.  Voice response - A few reviews stated that the new Echo didn't respond as quickly and lacked a tad when music was playing.  I found this not be be true.  It responds as quickly as the previous echos, even with music playing.3.  Sound quality - These new echos promise better sound.  I found this to be true.  It definitely has better sound than the previous echos.  They are loud and the bass is quality.  I am very happy with the sound as this is the only way I listen to music in my house.So, overall, I am glad I bought two new echos.

When I upgraded to smart thermostats I purchased one that has Alexa built in. I noticed recently that the Echo was not interpreting my requests very well and frequently would not play a song after a request. I assumed it was just getting old so decided to upgrade to this latest device that was on sale during Prime days. I assumed there would be a significant improvement in sound quality but it is marginally better. not enough to justify replacement. I find I need to yell at this echo for it to recognize my voice, the old one worked much better. Lastly, I moved my old 2nd gen echo into the upstairs bedroom thinking I could play music up there but Alexa does not support that. Appears you need to have an individual Amazon account for each device if you want to have it play Spotify.

The bass is insane, to the point where you have to turn it down to hear much of anything else. The midrange is recessed to a nearly objectionable amount, but for the price it's tolerable, I guess.Amazon must do something with spatial audio because the stereo image on these is also insane. Very nice.As for the Alexa thing, I already have four other Alexa eavesdroppers. This is more a review of Echo as an audio device and stereo deal. Short version: don't do it.Linking my two echoes together was easy enough, but one got put in  one ""room"" and one unassigned, and after days I can't for the life of me figure out how to get that other Echo into the same ""room"", but it's just a labeling thing. Connecting them in stereo was simple. Then came the issues.First... these only work in stereo if you stream from an official Amazon(tm) service. That means Amazon music (and probably Prime video). So if you wanted to use these in stereo for TV or YouTube... nope. Doesn't work.And even using this with Amazon Music... is problematic. I have to connect to the pair twice before they start playing, but I can deal with that. But then the Amazon Music app might reset and then I have zero control of what's playing. The speakers keep going on the playlist, somehow, but the app completely loses any sense of what's going on. So seeing what's playing or skipping songs isn't do-able.And as a Zigbee hub... well one works great, but Alexa has no sense of common controls like changing light colors in a group (only individually). It's a great piece of hardware stymied by limited software. There's no reason Alexa couldn't crib notes from every other zigbee app out there, and use my wifi network to stream audio data from one Echo to the others when I bluetooth connect to it.

The 2 speakers coupled with a subwoofer makes for a nice sound with a balance of bass and treble. The voice detection and interface is very good. The reactive bottom lighting is a great feature as well. Sort of reminds me of Kit from Knight Rider. Like you can tell it's thinking by the motion and color of the light.My only gripe is that you cannot access your YouTube music account. I'm positive this is because Google, whom owns YouTube, would rather you buy a Google smart device, so I switched to Amazon HD Music player. I'm new to the app so I'm still on the fence as to whether it's better or worse for music, although Amazon being HD music seems to have a little better quality. But YouTube has video, while Amazon does not. So if I have to get rid of YouTube Red I will miss being able to watch videos with no commercials. Unless I keep both, but all of these streaming services are starting to add up to a lot of bills.But overall, I'd say the Alexa device is one of the more attractive and high end sounding speakers available, especially when considering it was on sale for only $79. At that price, when it cones to sound quality, it's a little clearer sounding than my JBL Charge 2 $350 Bluetooth speaker. The Amazon doesn't get as loud as the JBL, but at mid and lower volume it sounds noticeably clearer.The AI, Alexa seems to give better and more detailed answers than my Google devices.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

The bass is crazy for such little speaker. It gets loud.the glass shelf I have it on will literally rattle anything on the glass off. Alexa is getting more and more smart with her updates and the such. It does take a couple trys at times to wake her but I would rather it be that way then too sensitive and just randomly turn on. I had bought this at best buy and it was on sale for 80 I wasn't even planning on buying a new alexa until I heard the sound quality and that it had a built in hub, which I am still learning but so far I have a philips hue bulb and she found it right away and it was so simple. I wasn't too fond of having a smart speaker and smart things but when your in bed at night and you just got comfortable she saves the day. Also using her to make phone calls is so much easier then using your phone just tell her who to call and she calls . That also goes for hanging up. Meanwhile use your phone for other things. I would recommend this. There is no question about how loud it gets or sound quality. The last thing I would say is if you don't think you need a hub or don't want one, this speaker is for you then because it already has one built in and zigbee is popular. It leaves that door open for so many devices. Watch one day you'll find a zigbee device and you'll remember that you have a built in hub.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

The 4th generation is a big disappointment; the placement of the microphone in the bottom (rather than the top as in earlier generations) makes it much less sensitive to voice command.  Frequently an older ECHO in a more distant room will respond to a command made directly to the 4th generation (while standing right in front of it.). Tried placing on a tripod (to raise the microphone) but no improvement.  For the best deal, the ""dot"" is best.  For best sound, the first or second generation is good (even bought a refurbished one which works great).  The Echo-plus w/ subwoofer is best for overall sound, but again, less sensitive to voice commands.  Sometimes with the Echo 4th generation, I honestly just miss the radio.  Or streaming thru my computer.  Terrible device.Follow up-got a call from Amazon and used the command button on top (round circle w/ circle inside) to reset the ""awake"" command.  Apparently some of these had sensitivity problems from the factory - but pushing the command/reset button for just a second allows the device to download an improved voice recognition system.  Much better now, so have revised up to 4 stars.  Put the device in our shop and walked outside to give awake command - worked fine.  Much more sensitive, and seems to have solved the problem completely.  Great sound too.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

The only thing that upsets me is how she isn\u2019t very well integrated with Apple Music. She can play public playlists that Apple produces and such but she can\u2019t play your own personal playlists. One other thing that disappoints me is that she can connect to a wide variety of Bluetooth speakers except for LG speakers. When setting up speakers it gives you options for tons of name brand companies but LG isn\u2019t there. Fret not because there is an option to set up a Bluetooth speaker not specified(such as Lg) but when trying to connect to Bluetooth Alexa couldn\u2019t seem to find my speaker even when set to Bluetooth mode. She found other things such as printers and such. I will try manually plugging my Alexa into my speaker but the point of using Bluetooth is so the speaker and Alexa are in different parts of the room/house. Other than those two minor things Alexa is a very fun device and incredibly useful as well. When looking through reviews I notice a fair amount of people complain about audio quality compared to other alexas and I have to say that I have worked a fair share in the audio business and when listening to my friends gen 3 Alexa play music compared to the gen 4 is totally different. The gen 4 completely blows the gen 3 out of the water. It just sounds more full and crisp. And if you\u2019re a stickler for certain sound adjusts then simply ask Alexa for more bass of treble and whatnot.\n,,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

On the other hand, I can be in another room and tell it the same command and most of the time it turns off. My guess is that the design takes away the omni-directional microphones and replaces them with microphones set withing the mesh, which doesn't cover the entire unit.

This is my first Echo I own, but I've seen 3rd Gen one on some of my friend's house and they were so excited to use it so I thought I'll give a try too (after an extensive research, as I was looking also at its direct competitor's offer, but now I'm really glad I've chosen Alexa).What is nice about 4th Gen is that it has a Zigbee hub (which was available previously on Echo Plus) and a temperature sensor built in, so I can always ask Alexa what is the current temperature in my room, which is great. I also have 2 Zigbee light bulbs paired directly with it in 2 separate rooms that could be easily controlled by voice or with Alexa app. Lately, I also bought an Aeotec Smart Things hub which Alexa handles nicely through SmartThings skill.Regarding the sound, I think it's great, the mids are crisp and the bass is rich and well contoured. I like very much that I can say ""Alexa, connect to my phone"" or my PC and I can play music on it within seconds via Bluetooth.I really like that Alexa is so smart and continuously learning from my voice and commands, and also I like that it recognizes my family members when they talk to it (my small daughter likes to ask how a particular animal sounds).I think Echo is a real benefit for elderly people or disabled ones, because so many things/commands can be done only by voice.In conclusion, I really love Echo 4th Gen, which has fast become a family companion.

Particularly, an audio upgrade. The two options I was considering: an Echo Studio, or two Echo 4th Gens paired together with their stereo function.I ended up buying two Amazon Echo 4th Gens when they went on sale for Prime Day.They were easy enough to pair together. HOWEVER - the stereo function does not work when you are playing anything via a Bluetooth connection (or a hard cable connection, for that matter).The Echo stereo function apparently over works when playing stuff over WiFi. I would say this sounded quite wonderful; a really impressive audio setup. If you play music or podcasts via Amazon music (or another platform that plays via WiFi accessible through Alexa), I'd say this is a worthwhile audio system.The problem - when I played audio (both music and podcasts) from my iPhone via Bluetooth, the audio would come from only one speaker. Hence, no stereo. My personal audio world runs almost exclusively through my iPhone, so this was obviously an issue for me.So is just one speaker worth it? I'd say the audio from one Echo 4th Gen is definitely an improvement over the 2nd Gen Echo I have. Whether it's a worthwhile upgrade is up to your individual ear.

And one fact is true ... amazon has done a very good job with making small improvements while keeping the costs down . This latest design is once again a minor improvement on the previous generations I own . The sound has improved a bit . Slightly more bass and treble . Still not a Sonos or a Bose ... but the cost isn\u2019t either . So it\u2019s a compromise . Glad they finally just included the \u201chub\u201d instead of 2 separate models . The design being a sphere is up for debate . One thing that isn\u2019t ... it\u2019s no longer a omnidirectional speaker . It sends sound where you point it . So unfortunately you can\u2019t bounce the sound off a wall to increase the bass like previous generations  . The look ? Meh ... kinda weird . But not a deal breaker . One complaint I have as well as others : the led indicator that lets you know it\u2019s listening is now on the bottom . Terrible placement . You just can\u2019t ever see it ! If it was higher or if it was much brighter perhaps . 2 things that I\u2019m not happy about at all  : 1) like others have said ... the microphones are no longer as sensitive as other generations . My older echos almost never miss when I ask a question , even clear across the house . This one ? I very often end up screaming at it , especially when the music is playing . Even when I\u2019m just a few feet away. It seems as though there are either less microphones or the ones on this model are not as discerning. Perhaps a software update in the future will improve this . ( note : I am not alone in my evaluation - others are having the same issue) 2)  My biggest dislike ? I purchased 2 black / charcoal echos ... and they give you white power cords with white power blocks ! White ? Seriously ? No doubt this is a cost saving measure so that they include the white ones across the board no matter what you order . But ... they are ugly as Hell ! They do not blend in at all . Hopefully they listen to all of us complaining and change this - as well as swap out our white ones for black ones . Amazon pulled a Henry Ford with the model T . You can have any color you want ... as long as it\u2019s Black ! One last thing - terrible WiFi reception !\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Previously this latest generation Echo worked well.I called customer service and asked for Amazon Digital Device Support. I was speaking with someone from the Phillipines and she did not know what I was talking about!So, I asked that the Echo be replaced since I had tried to re-sync it multiple times to WiFi and then gone through the setup procedure 4 times! It still would not work..I asked that a replacement be sent me and I would send this one back (it is still under warranty).She replied that there would be a fee for that. Since it is still under warranty, I told her that was not correct. It seemed as if she had been reading from a script  and seemed flummoxed. She paused for long periods and put me on hold as if she was reading through procedure steps.I asked her not to waste time, but she continued to pause and put me on hold!Finally I hung up and called back, hoping to connect with someone who was more professionally competent.At that time with the app I had been unable to reach Digital Device support. I now know I could have gone through a different pathway to get Them on the phone!!I did get a Digital Device support person from Jamaica on the phone, but she insisted on going through her script, then hung up on me.I finally got Hussain on the phone and he walked me through a factory re-set, which I did not know about, and which (understandably) is not in the Alexa app.That solved the problem, Thank you Hussain! He and I both hypothesize that this issue was caused by a glitch in the latest firmware update! Amazon coders, Please look into this!What a time consuming Nightmare!P.S. I am a long time IT professional..\n",2 people found this helpful,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

No longer will I have to buy two of these for stereo sound.  The improvement in sound is absolutely outstanding with the price I paid being the same as with the older generation.  There is also major improvement to the subwoofer that allows for better bass when in use.  The sound edges the Echo Show 8 and is completely superior to the current generation Echo Show 5.  Against my older pair of Echo 2nd generations, this one speaker is an extreme improvement.  The microphone to pick up your voice is better at range than before, but since this is not a 360 speaker, you have to be within 110 degrees of the front and center for your voice to be recognized.  This is easily dealt with by proper placement.  I think this works best against a wall to force the acoustics to angle forward more.  This Echo certainly keeps up with voice commands, and using Zigbee is seamless.\n",2 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

It might be more accurately described as a love/hate relationship, but at the end of the day, I Adore that spicy bish. I love asking Alexa  strange questions or just throwing out song requests or a reminder or timer throughout my day, I utilize the crap out of her! Alexa answers are hit and miss, I do receive a lot of ""Sorry, I don't know that"" but all in all the idea behind Alexa is sound. I have owned at least 1 Echo and an echo dot (if available) since its inception, and continue to be impressed with the utility of it. This generation of Echo has been a real disappointment to me. While Alexa is becoming more fluid in this iteration,  in some ways it feels like a rather large step back from its predecessors.  Let's talk about this generations audio, shall we? I dislike that when using verbal commands to Alexa for volume up or volume down, it's  very basic and uses a 1-10 system. This can be modified using the plus or minus sign on the device itself, or using the Alexa app on phones (which, to its credit, allows for a 1% to 100% sliding scale to get the desired volume). However, if you are like me and want to be able to say ""Alexa, set volume to 22%"" Alexa will set the volume to the nearest  1-10 volume, in this case, it would set the Echo to volume 2. As an audiophile this feels clunky and lacks ease of use I've come to expect from Echo devices. The sound quality is alright, but I miss the 360 degree sound that previous generations gave me. Fourth generation Echo's also lack music clarity, and the bass is not impressive in the least.Next up, the shape, sigh. This 4th generation Echo looks like a crystal ball and takes up more space while also being a lot more noticeable. Perhaps this is intentional, but I prefer the more discreet shape of the 3rd generation. I am not impressed with them doing collaborations with designers like Diane Von Furstenberg when so many more necessary features like better audio quality and the Echo's voice sensitivity are sorely lacking. I'd love to see Amazon do a partnership with a company like Boss, to give us useful upgrades and higher audio quality.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I purchased 2 chargeable batterys so I can take anywhere where no outlets are.  Battery has decent longevity 4-5 hours.4. Compact and the round shape gives it personality and not bulky. Comes in different colors.I don't like because:1. I have 5 echos in different rooms.  Sometimes when you ask Alexa to play music in the ""everywhere  mode"" Not all the echos respond....some are on and some off.  I called help and they advised me to reverse the plug. After that all the echos responded but its doing it again.2. Sometimes Alexa does not respond to my voice command which is frustrating.3. Sometimes Alexa voice is tinny and not the full normal volume that she usually responds with and the music is tinny and not full either. I have to try and unplug and try to see if that fixes the problem....it's hit and miss which irritates me.I just purchased from Amazon so they are new echos.

I purchased two: one for my living room and one for my bedroom. The speaker I placed in my living room works well when I'm working from home. I use the speaker in my bedroom as a white noise machine for sleeping.Likes:* Rich bass for such a small speaker* Volume can get as loud as you'll likely want it. I've never tested the full range because anything above 70% will disturb my neighbors.* Alexa is pretty helpful, though I'm not a smarthome power user by an means* Integrates with Spotify, which I like much better than Apple music* Blends in to my furniture* Intelligent enough to detect which Echo I'm speaking to (bedroom vs. living room), and only play music or respond from that speaker.* Echo app store is a great idea that I didn't get with my Google home or Apple homepod. Didn't even know it existed before buying. I use the white noise app every night.Dislikes* The microphone is directional, so sometimes when I'm speaking to Alexa at an angle, it doesn't pick it up.* The ring of lights that announce when it's listening is facing down. If you place the Echo above eye level, you can't see it.* The white cord it comes with is pretty flimsy. I just hide it behind furniture, but could bother some people* Alexa app looks a little outdated.

When we asked our original Echo to play a song, it played the song we asked for and then stopped, exactly the behavior we wanted.  Now, if we ask for a song Alexa automatically shuffles the song we requested with ""similar songs"", and most often does not play the requested song first, In addition, Alexa only allows 6 skipped songs per hour, even though she is playing we never asked for.3.  Sometimes Alexa will refuse to play a song unless we upgrade to ""unlimited"" (which we already have), even though she played the song recently.  Then, after we decline the upgrade she will shuffle he song we requested in with similar songs, and then play the similar songs instead of the one requested.We find all of these ""features"" frustrating in the extreme and have felt like smashing the Echo to pieces.Thanks, Amazon the wrecking a peaceful and enjoyable pastime and replacing it with something that raises both blood pressures and tempers more often than not.If your review system allowed 0-star reviews I would have selected it.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

This is important to me, since I use Alexa to control lights (WeMo/Lutron), fans (Big Ass Fans), thermostats (Nest) and stream audio throughout my home.Having gone through generations of Echos (starting with Gen1), it's apparent that some internal changes make a bigger difference in performance than is typically revealed by Amazon and in most reviews (which focus on audio quality).Overall, really impressed with this latest version.\n",2 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

It is GREAT for aforementioned casual listening, typically with good voice recognition and response. It is NOT quite as accomplished with a stereo pairing for more focused (and higher volume) listening. The Sub really does well with rounding out the frequencies Echo can achieve in music, though it\u2019s no heavy-hitter. Then again, it\u2019s a 6\u201d woofer and not designed to be that, so that\u2019s ok. The Echos themselves do well up until about a 70-75% volume level, then start showing hints of distorting, even harshness. You can adjust the EQ settings, but even bringing down the treble does not resolve the top end being overwhelmed with upper volume.Thus, for a typical/casual music listener that\u2019s not going to push these too much, it\u2019s probably the best all-around Echo!

Whoever thought coupling a white power cord with a black-colored product needs to be fired. The first and second BLACK Echo products came with....wait for it.. BLACK power cords. Because if you are buying something in black, it is probably to pair with room decor. So having a very obvious WHITE cable paired with BLACK setting defeats the purpose. Obviously, the product in white coming with a white power cord is a great match; very stupid design choice. It looks like a duckpin bowling ball or a magic eight ball. Very odd. Bought 3 and will keep them since they were half-price. The white looks nice enough but the black only works if you can properly hide the entire cable. I did some voice recognition testing and the Echo Plus 2nd generation won that battle. HOWEVER at 50% off......that is ok. The white cable is clearly ridiculous.

I've used Echos for years and it keeps getting better. This is not an audiophiles system and shouldn't be compared. It is a very adequate system for those of us who aren't anal about sound.I have two connected with the subwoofer in a 5th wheel trailer. I'm completely pleased with the sound. The bass was a bit overpowering, but I was able to adjust that with built in equalizer.It seems which ever echo microphone I'm closest to picks up commands and hasn't failed yet. I'm about 8 feet from either one and it always hears and responds well.These have the built in hub so I'm able to control lights which is cool.If you've had other echos you know what they do. I don't see how you can go wrong with them.If there is a downside its that I use a separate Dolby atmos 5.1 system for movies, TV etc. Maybe someday echos will come with rear channels?So to update this, I connected the two echo gen 4s to Firestick which was easy, however the result is not a happy ending. I still enjoy the Echo gen 4 has music etc streaming source, but this does not provide a theater experience like a designated 5.1 or 7.1 system. I found I had to crank the volume up all the way to get acceptable sound level.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I was able to connect a Philips Hue bulb and it seems to be working well as a hub - it's a nice feature. The temperature sensor seems to be working well. I'm not a fan of the lights being underneath reflecting off the surface. It's more difficult to see them and I miss the large rotating volume knob which is much more intuitive to use. It was impossible to add the new speaker to my existing speaker group - seems to be a bug of some sort with the Alexa app (iOS). I couldn't stream to the device using my Amazom Music app, also seems to be a bug of some sort with the app (iOS).ORIGINAL REVIEW 10/23/2020I was hoping the audio quality of the 4th gen was going to be better than my first gen echo. I listened to them side by side and the don't sound THAT different - not worth the cost of replacement. The new version is louder, has slightly more pronounced bass and fills the room about the same when against the wall. The sound of the new one seems unbalanced. The highs are tinny and overbearing. Mids are understated and the bass is so-so. Overall the sound is top heavy and flat.Its width takes up a lot more space, about double over the first gen. The buttons on top are kind of difficult to press - they're hard to feel without looking, shaped into small symbols instead of chunky round buttons and not that responsive. The original echo's buttons were easier to navigate without looking.I don't mind the white cable because it blends in better with the white walls.If you don't mind having 2 devices, I would suggest going with an echo dot and buying a good quality bluetooth speaker. The flexibility of taking the speaker elsewhere with you and the sound quality will be much better.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I did sync the two on the first floor  and it worked for a while. Then they got out of sync and started echoing. Drove my husband crazy two mornings. I woke up with him screaming at it. Thought he was going to have a heart attack. Had to un-sync them and use them separately. That defeated the purpose I got them for. Many times it does not understand us.

This review is for the 4th gen echo with premium sound. The sound really is great. I am very impressed because it isn't very big. It has punchy bass... I mean it obviously isn't a 10"" woofer, but it really is nice. It has very good sound throughout the range. I have historically had Harman Kardon and Klipsch speakers so I will use those as a reference.I would say this speaker has superior sound than any single Klipsch or Harman Kardon bookshelf speaker I have previously owned. I am not comparing it to the entire system obviously with 5 speakers and a couple subwoofers. But any single speaker, including the center channel, I would put it up against. Most people would say that isn't a fair comparison because these are wireless stand alone units. Lets just say the sound is bright and covers all ranges very fairly, especially when considering the size of the speaker.I know this isn't a fair comparison, but we replaced the echo 3rd gen dot with this and it is so far superior.

Audio is overly boomy. Sidewalk Bridge function is unreliable.,"\nI own both the full size Echo 4th, and the Echo Dot 4th with LED Clock. I purchased two of the full size Echo 4th devices to allow for connectivity for Ring Bridge devices, notably a Ring Mailbox Sensor and a Ring Lighting Motion Sensor, both of which require either a Ring Bridge, or a Sidewalk Bridge device. This Echo device is specifically named as a recommendation. I gave it a shot, and both the mailbox sensor and the motion sensor went offline repeatedly, even when placed just a few inches from the Echo 4th Gen unit. Sometimes they came back online on their own. Sometimes they ran their batteries dead trying. I returned one of the sensors thinking I had a bad one and got the same results. When I bought a dedicated Ring Bridge, all the problems went away. Sidewalk Bridge simply isn't working and isn't reliable.As for the other features, the audio quality when listening to music or just hearing Alexa's voice is very boomy by default. I haven't tried playing with the equalizer, but really, I should be able to get decent quality from default settings.Voice recognition is hit-or-miss if you're not using Alexa as your wake word. It doesn't seem to matter much if you're facing the unit directly when you speak to it or if you're just somewhere in the room. Recognition is about the same either way, for better or worse.The unit itself is HUGE, and the audio is comparable to the Echo Dot 4th Gen, so if you're faced with a choice between the two and don't need Sidewalk, I'd recommend the Echo Dot.Lastly, the surface is covered with cloth, meaning that cleaning it isn't much of an option. I suspect that at some point, mine will look dingy enough from touching the buttons that I'll want to re-wrap it. Or maybe I should do that preemptively.

We got it during the Christmas sale for $59 which is a fantastic price for what you get.  We've never had one of these Alexa speakers before and we love it!  Sometimes she doesn't register our requests so we repeat ourselves and she usually gets it the 2nd time.  It is amazing what we can do with this.  Music and podcasts sound awesome!  Instant weather reports, news, just general questions, voice and routine light bulb control and she can even tell you the temp in the room (very cool).  I've written a few simple routines and she follows them without fail.  It is amazing the volume and fidelity of the speakers (two tweeters and one woofer) is amazing.

Reconsider!,"\nLet me start off by saying I have been a LONG time user of the Echo platform, since gen one and have been a proponent of the platform. I have 20+ echo's and even upgraded some of them as time passes so maybe gone through 30. I just ran across an issue that had apparently popped up sometime last summer but just happened to us as well. I have bought all the Echo's in our family and registered them under my name, pretty standard. Up until we switched phones 3 weeks ago, my wife, who is in my household account, was ALWAYS able to go into her Alexa app and set alarms and reminders on any of our Echo's. As of yesterday that no longer is the case. She can only set alarms or reminders for her phone.I spent 2+ hours texting with 5 people in tech support, got so frustrated that I asked to be connected in person on a call. Talked to two more tech support people on the phone as well. They are telling(insisting) me that only the person who has the Echo registered to their name can set alarms or reminders on those Echo's. So if you have three kids with phones, they can no longer set alarms on any echo device. You can do it verbally still of course. But now if they want an alarm/reminder set in their room they have to walk up the stairs and verbally set it. How does this make ANY sense that only one person in a household can access the alarm/reminders on their mobile devices!?! Takes away half of our functionality!The funny thing is, every one of those techs said that is how it is supposed to work, even though for the last 4+ years my wife has been able to set her own alarms and reminders for our kids. THIS TAKES AWAY HALF THE FUNCTIONALITY OF ECHO'S(if you have a family). That is how she set our kids alarms all through COVID. After a quick google search I found several AMAZON FORUM posts going back a year that this has been happening to other people as well. Just google 'Unable to view or set alarms on Household devices' and you can read for yourself. I screenshotted them as I suspect they will somehow disappear.I think something might be changing at Amazon with the Echo platform and they are slowly taking away this functionality as peoples accounts change or something. I can't make rhyme or reason of it that more people haven't brought this up though. But based on the silly Amazon rep responses and the consistent denial that this was a viable function from multiple Amazon tech's, Amazon appears to have no reason to try and fix this. I suspect they may be rolling out some sort of paid service for Echo's soon. How much money did Bezos lose until Amazon became ubiquitous with everyone was ordering online? He did just recently run up in the annual fee, etc.  Get them a taste or two for free then get them hooked. He is playing the long game for sure. Just my conspiracy theory.Anyways, I will definitely be sending back the other Echo's and thermostats I just bought and may look at switching over to google's devices. Thankfully all my home switches are compatible. Just beware, Echo is no longer nearly as useful for families(or households) anymore and you may want to avoid.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

Sphere shape less likely to knock over.,"\nFirst off, I didn't upload an image, because the Echo unit I have looks exactly the same as every other pic of it. It's pretty. Though, I don't know why if Amazon redesigned Echo units, why not offer more color choices this time around?????? Why not a red, green, eggplant purple?? I also liked the turn-dial volume control on the older unit. I think it offered more exact control and ease of use, as well as the light ring that used to be on top, as opposed to now being in the very bottom of the unit. A person could see the entire ring when it was in top, now you can only see the portion of the ring you're facing, as it rotates and disappears behind the opposite side of the unit, ....like the dark side of the moon. The Sound however, I think is an improvement. The old unit sounded great considering it's size. But this unit, although not noticebly bigger, has better bass, and wider overall sound quality. And SOUND is the whole point for me. Alexa's assistance with information and home-living is very helpful, but I purchased Echo for the ease of placing music in every room and access to just about any song I can think of.  And with that priority in mind, I think this new unit is improved.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

I had this item in my cart for a month before buying as I wanted to make sure that this was not an emotional purchase. I can tell you now that the wait was totally worth it as the device blew me away when I had it setup. The sound is a big step up to the echo dots I have. Deep bass and decent highs make the music come alive. You do have to find a good spot though. I would recommend placing it in a corner with the least clutter as show in the pic. Placing it on top a wooden furniture will also enhance the bass.Now to the smart home functions. The device was able to detect my smart devices fairly easily. Be sure to have your smart devices in pairing mode before trying to discover. So far there have been some hit and miss in terms of configuring my smart devices. However once they are up and running they work fine. My tip here is to give your smart bulbs etc easy to pronounce names. This will prevent alexa having to ask you which one did you mean etc.I do have one thing I disliked, a software peeve. The alexa app needs a redesign in terms of it not being very intuitive for handling devices. I have a samsung smart thing and the interface is way better in managing my smart device.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

My phone, TV, and I think it must be my rug or something, already knows even what I'm thinking about.Anyway, I was hoping it could change my TV channels at least, but that involved buying another gizmo. OH --""PREMIUM SOUND"". Not sure what that means but it isn't hifi Bose quality. More like enhance AM radio.That voice ... annoying, so I changed it. It says you can change the voice, but its only male of female. And they say you can change the wake up name. There are only a couple that you can choose from a list as well. All with multiple syllables, and I want a one syllable name..like JOE... Hey Joe. So it stays Alexa with a male voice.I love the shape and look, and with the added light at the base, it looks pretty cool. It would be even better if the entire globe radiated soft pastel colors and then jumped bright red when someone is detected at the front video doorbell You could keep the yellow for when a package is delivered by Amazon.THe jokes are pretty corny. The weather report is great, and it can tell you what temperature is residing at its location. Overall use for TV is great if you have a Fire TV. It wants to go to Fire TV over ROKU or even cable. Changing cable using the Fire TV Blaster is a bit hit or miss. It doesn't respond the same to even the same command to change the channel. Overall using Alexa to control the TV is hit or miss anyway. Much easier to just use the remote.My overall assessment is that it's a cool gimmick, not really practical. That might be me though, as I'm old. A longtime tech-head, but an old one. Sometimes cool factor of a product isn't worth the bother.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Sound is EXCELLENT!,"\nThis is a great sounding speaker. Basic Alexa works great as far as looking stuff up for you. If you want a good music device this is great if you buy a Amazon Music subscription. If you have spotify you won't be able to request a particular track but it will play music similar to what you requested but not the one. ALWAYS A CATCH. If you want to connect this device to a bluetooth speaker it's easy till you want to switch it off and back on again.  It will disconnect and will connect back up again but it won't send the audio to the speaker again till you delete the pairing and pair again. So I was hoping the bluetooth function would work but it doesn't. MORE TROUBLE THAN IT'S WORTH. Getting my Wyze vacuum to work with it was a failure. Once it loaded the skill and found the vacuum it said all was go. ""Ask Wyze to clean"" So I did and it said ""there was a problem."" and NOTHING ELSE? Again, more trouble than it's worth!

Two things I want to suggest for developing teams. Echo can pair with others to become a stereo, but it is only compatible with the same version Echo and Echo Sub. Ideally would be one Echo and two Echo dot. Another thing would be that there should be a separate volume of the Audio and Alexa. Since I used it for audio on my PC and the volume on the PC is fixed, there is only Echo's volume I can change. The Alexa sound would be extremely big and my PC sound would be small, so I either give up Alexa or turn the volume down every single time.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Makes me long for my Gen1 Echo.,"\nUpdate: 28 Jan 2022I've really had it with this thing; it's a hot, steaming pile.  I recently went through a phase where the ring would light yellow, letting me know that there were new notifications waiting.  I'd say, ""Alexa, read my notifications,"" and the Echo would tell me that I had no notifications.  Asking a second time would usually result in success.  Then this morning, the Echo decided to shout to the world that we'd added breakfast sandwiches to our shopping list.  Mind you, I NEVER touch the volume controls -- on the device or on the app -- except to reset them when the Echo decides to shout at me.  This morning it shouted so loud that it woke two of my children on ANOTHER FLOOR.  I'm done with this piece of junk.  It's now packed away in my basement, and I've brought my Gen1 back online.----------I was an early and aggressive adopter of Echo products over the years.  I bought my Gen1 Echo during the pre-release phase, have had several Dots, and now have several Shows as bedroom alarm clocks.  So when I bought my Gen4 Echo to replace my original Gen1, I did so with great expectations.  Let me tell you how disappointed I am.The first thing I noticed was that when paired to my iPad (which sits right next to the Echo on my kitchen island), the audio frequently crackles and drops.  This was never an issue with my Gen1, and the behavior has persisted across pairing to my iPhone and two different iPads.  That makes me pretty confident that the issue is in the Echo, and not in the attached devices.The next major issue is with volume control on the Gen4.  I still haven\u2019t figured it out.  I have tried the on-device controls and the Volume and Sound settings in the Alexa app, but there seems to be no logic to what volume the Echo responds to me.  I can ask Alexa for a weather report and all is fine, then a few seconds later ask Alexa to add something to my shopping list, only to hear the Echo shout the response.  The Echo will announce a reminder softly, and then boom my notifications when I ask.  Adjusting and re-adjusting the Volume and Sound settings in the Alexa app solves the problem temporarily, but the issue resumes not long after.More recently, the Echo has started playing music after announcing reminders or playing announcements.  It wasn\u2019t playing music before, and no one asked it to start playing music; it just does it on its own.  (This behavior was kind of funny the first few times, but now I\u2019m getting tired of telling the Echo to stop playing music after it tells me to take out the trash or clean the guinea pig cage\u2026)And then there\u2019s the \u201cspinning blue ring issue\u201d that seems to have cropped up recently.  Frequently over the last few days, I\u2019ve caught the Echo with the light ring illuminated blue, with a slightly brighter blue indicator spinning round and round.  It will do this for minutes at a time, stop, and then just start doing it again later.  During this time, the device is non-responsive.I never saw these issues with the Gen1, nor do my Shows seem to have so many issues.  But I\u2019m thoroughly disappointed with the Gen4.  It truly makes me wish I had my Gen1 back.  My opinion:  Save your money and avoid this one.  Maybe the Gen5 will be better.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

My review on the 3rd generation keeps getting deleted under the claim that it has been determined that I received a genuine product, and therefore my review has been deleted. I made it clear that changes to Prime Music (thanks to a failing Alexa department) causes dissatisfaction with the product and certainly not a claim of a fake or poor device. I guess people like me are not happy with their purchase of Echo devices, thanks to the changes to Prime Music, and Amazon is trying to stop the impact on their Echo devices, but when the two are linked, exactly what do they expect!I wish there was a way to get my money back. My entire family loved Amazon Music, and we purchased numerous Echo products as a result. Many hours of homework spent with the Echo devices as well as the app in the car, at home and school. Our recommendations meant other people purchased Echo products as well. However, the most recent update to Prime Music means a poor imitation of Spotify!I instantly knew there was trouble when Amazon sent a ""marketing"" email in an attempt to convince us that the changes were an improvement to the service when it really is not. My children very quickly uninstalled the Prime Music app (their Echos are now used exclusively as light switches and alarm clocks--just crazy) and now use YouTube Music for playing the music they want to listen to. I have just done the same off all my devices. Amazon claims there is more variety as there is apparently more song content available, but anyone who has enjoyed Prime Music before, instantly notices that a loss in control of content masquerades as a claim of variety.I am now trying to decide between throwing my useless Alexa devices away, or finding someone willing to pay for Unlimited to take the devices off my hands.What no longer works that has caused me to class the Echo devices as useless, even as it now prompts for an upgrade?1. Downloaded songs no longer play on the app2. Can't thumbs down a song3. Can't repeat a song4. Can't skip more than 5 of the songs Amazon forces me to listen to5. Can't play our playlists (starts with the first song, but then switches to playing random, similar music to the first song only and not the songs on the actual playlist. If you request a playlist, the response says, ""playing x playlist and other similar songs."" Cannot play a diverse list of genres, just what is similar to the first song, I mean really, a radio plays more diversity).0 stars for a previous 5 star device because of changes to Prime Music!\n",,

I was reluctant to buy it because I thought it was ugly, but I was happily surprised to find that it is actually quite attractive.Some quick background:  Along with this Gen 4 Echo, I own two Gen 1 Echos, two Gen 2 Echos, and two Gen 3 Echos, along with several non-Amazon Alexa-capable.The sound quality is a small, but noticeable, step forward from the previous (3rd) generation Echo.  It is not a big enough step forward that you should replace your 3rd Gen Echo, however.  What IS nice is that it has a built in thermostat (so you can ask Alexa what the inside temp is, which could be a nice feature when out of town).  Also, it has the built-in hub capability.Compared to 1st and 2nd Gen Echos, the sound and microphone quality is massively improved.  I retired a Gen 1 Echo when I bought this one, and the difference is huge.  I would recommend replacing your first or second generation Echo with this one.  I would hold on to your third generation Echo.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

I also have purchased several Echo Dots in that time.  I like how each sounds but I have to admit the Echo 1st Gen with hub sounds great, much better than the Dots.  I didn't and don't have a problem with it, it still sounds great and responds great.  It sounds so great I had been planning on getting a second one to go in another room for some time.  So since I kept seeing the new 4th Gen Echo advertised for around $70 I couldn't pass it up.  I read the reviews about having to repeat ""Alexa"" being an issue but I didn't realize how bad it would be until I ran into the problem myself.  I have it in my bedroom on my nightstand and you would think that no matter what position you are in it would hear you when you are lying on the bed with the speaker about a foot away.  But that's not the case, if you are facing away from the speaker you almost have to yell ""Alexa"", so that your sound bounces off one of the walls, to get a response.  And this is the case no matter where you are in the room.  You have to face the speaker to get a constant response.  I don't have that problem with the 1st Gen speaker.  If it only had only happened a couple of times I wouldn't care, but it's constant.But not all is bad about the speaker.  I know that some of the reviews mentioned about it's tone being a little too low.  I actually like the sound it puts out.  This is far better than my 1st Gen and the Dots.  After all the ranting about having to repeat my demands, the sound, at least for me, does make up for it and I do plan on buying another one to get a more stereo effect.I still don't think that it warrants four or five stars because it is a smart speaker, and if previous generations function better at performing that function, there is definitely room for improvement for this gen.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I ordered it because it was a start to a hub network and for voice commands  as our house is pretty decent sized. I was less concerned about the sound quality. I was so impressed I ordered 3 more on prime day as well as a couple of echo dots. It\u2019s pretty cool to fill an entire floor with sound but not have to have the volume cranked up in one spot.

But if I paid more than $60 I'd be disappointed. If you have the space a good sound bar works well and sounds great with a dot. But in small spaces where flat surfaces are at a premium, but you still want ""good"" sound, this a good choice. The sound is richer and fills the room better than just a dot. If you buy new from Amazon, using the aleza app, it practically sets itself up. Great for the Kitchen, Master Bath, Kids Bedroom or small apartment. But if your an audiophile it won't impress you as a stand alone source for music in larger living areas. Its good, and better than a dot, but not a value over the price of a good sound system. You get what pay for, think in terms of the speaker inside, given the price what do expect that priced speaker to sound like, don't expect it too sound like $400 to $800 Bose, because it doesn't cost close to that.

The mics on the Echo plus were a little sluggish so I thought why not upgrade and move my echo plus to another part of the house that is less used.  Well the new Echo showed up a little early and I even went through the payment plan.  I thought that the new generation should have all kinds of woops and whistles than what I originally had.Well the first thing that I enjoyed was the integration of dual languages.  With me learning Spanish this I thought would be a fun feature.  Well it seams that this version has still a lot of issues.  My commands are not recognized very often.  When I try to play something from xm it just errors.  I have to use my echo show to play on the network I choose.  Now it plays fine on the new Echo but it just does not seem to take commands very well.  The spanish commands are hit and miss but right on with the echo show.Overall I am very disappointed with the replacement.  If it wasn't for my smart home features I may even consider sending it back till they can get it right.  The first and second gen plus is still very cheap and I could just replace it with that from ebay or something.(update)  So tech support reached out to me and was concerned as well.  It seems that my Echo Show is less sensitive to commands than the echo plus.  The echo plus being more sensitive, would not know how to respond if there was an extra word in the command.  As for the Language issue well it worked fine the first time the tech was listening but the second time it would not respond saying it had a limited vocab.  They will work on it.  Because they were so nice about it I told them I would update my original review to include their exceptional service.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

I have become increasingly frustrated with it's inability to hear me.  Sometimes I have to yell so loud that the bedroom Echo responds instead of the one in the family room.  I'm seriously considering returning this one and using my old gen 1 Echo.  Either Amazon needs to improve the sensitivity or give us the ability to adjust it ourselves.I bought this to replace a gen 1 tower.  I have several echo devices around the house and liked the old cylinder.  I won\u2019t comment on the aesthetics since that is a personal preference, but will say the new design requires a larger footprint on the table.  The base is small, but the diameter of the sphere means you can\u2019t put anything close to the bottom of the base.  Functionally, the sound quality is much better than the gen 1 device.  I appreciate that the new design probably was necessary for that.  The new echo is much more directional.  This is good if you have it against a wall, but not if it is in the middle of the room.  The light ring at the base makes it difficult to see on a low table or if there is something on the table next to it (like a book).  I have a lot of trouble seeing if Alexa heard me.  Speaking of that...it seems Alexa is aging and has a lot more trouble hearing me than the old one did.  I find I have to talk loudly to be heard and with the light ring at the bottom, I have to be in the right position to see if she\u2019s responding.  The built in hub was a bonus.  I have a hub from years ago, so have not made use of it yet, but will eventually try to retire the hub I have.  I like the new device, but will not be replacing any of my gen 3 dots with the new dots.  I wish they still sold the gen 3s with the clock.  I\u2019ll wait for the next revision and see how I feel about those.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

As for audio, this is the first ""Alexa"" device I've owned so I cannot compare it to previous models' sound quality.  The bass is okay, but I agree with others who say the treble speakers used in the device could have been better.  You won't get component stereo hi-fi sound out of the device and there's no way I've found that will boost the frequencies on the high end. It sounds more like what comes from speakers with the ""tweeters"" not working very hard and the mid-range speakers trying to make up for that fact.  I would still recommend the device for its functionality, but while possibly better sounding than the standard Alexa 4th Gen Echo, this version's ""enhanced"" sound quality will still be underwhelming to audiophiles.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

At home I use smart things with echo dots all over and it works great when our echos aren\u2019t deaf or, now suddenly, trying to advertise crap after being given a conmand (if you\u2019re reading this Amazon I\u2019m about to rip every Amazon device out because of that bs).At my office though I just needed a small amount of devices to control and make a few automations with and I thought this would kill 2 birds with one stone. Man was I wrong.My first complaint is everything after two days shows up as unresponsive. It still works with voice commands or in the app but you constantly have the darn thing chiming back at you to say \u201ctable warmer is unavailable please check the Alexa app or this device is offline please check the Alexa app for further information\u201d and you can\u2019t make it stop. Considering I\u2019m using it in my massage studio this is beyond annoying when it blurts that out while Al client is already on the table.Routines suck too. You cannot use more than one sensor in a routine.  I wanted it to do certain things like it the door sensor opens and you detect motion turn on this this and this. No.  You can only use one either the door or the motion but not both. This hub has been out for 5 years how is it still this basic?Want to see the history of your sensors? Tough s***. You cannot see a log (at least I cannot find where and I\u2019ve looked) of the sensor.  Did someone come into my office when I wasn\u2019t there? Who the heck knows because I can\u2019t see the log.  The guard thing is annoying. I just wanted what I thought was basic smart home stuff. What I got was the kindergarten version of a smart home hub.Amazon you are FAILING miserably between the Alexa advertisements and interruptions and the smart home hub. Like I mentioned earlier I\u2019m about to rip every Amazon assistant from my home and find something better if they don\u2019t fix it. If I ask for the weather that\u2019s all I want. I don\u2019t want you rambling on about a new skill I can buy or something else you can do. Just do what is ask and stop. But no it\u2019s all about money.I used to love these things now I just find myself yelling at them because they go deaf and can\u2019t turn on a simple light or telling it to shut up because it goes off the rails.  I have one dot in the living room that can hear EVERYTHING, I have the same versions in each room and that one dot almost never misses a beat when I ask it to do something even in other rooms. The others I can be standing two feet from and it can\u2019t hear a truck plowing through the house to save it. In total I have 6 new dots at home and this 1 plus at work.

What I like the most is that this Echo can still hear my wakeup word even while music is playing, something that was extremely difficult to do on the first gen Echo without having to SCREAM the wakeup word several times. Those two things are the main positive differences for me. I do not use the ultrasound motion sensor on this device, nor the Zigbee hub (because although I can connect Zigbee stuff to it, the current status of those devices is never registered/updated; totally useless). A couple cool additional features over the old device is the ability to use different voices and multilanguage. A big dislike for me is that the light ring is at the bottom.

After they rang, I set another 30-minute timer (I know I nap quite a bit). However, after the new timer is set, the old timer kept ringing. So I said to Alexa with my dreamy eyes, ""Alexa, turn off the alarm"" to which Alexa replied, ""there is no active alarm.""Thinking that the 30-minute timer is canceled too, I told Alexa again, ""Alexa, set a timer for 30 minutes."" It replied, ""Second alarm set for 30 minutes."" Frustrated, I then told Alexa to clear all timers and set just 1 alarm for 30 minutes, to which it replied, ""Third alarm set for 30 minutes.""Not wanting three alarms to go off one after another, I asked Alexa to clear all timers. Alexa then read to me, that I have 3 active timers set, with the FIRST timer set to 30 minutes and X minutes X seconds remaining, the SECOND timer set to 30 minutes X minutes X seconds remaining, the THIRD timer set to 30 minutes and X minutes X seconds remaining, which one did I want to cancel. I said ""all of them."" Alexa then said ""timer all of them"" was not found and then hung up on me. I then had to tell it to cancel my timers again. It repeated the same information about each of the timers, which took a very long minute, and then proceeded to ask me which timer I wanted to cancel again. ""You have a 30-minute timer with 23 minutes and 40 seconds left, a 30-minute timer with 25 minutes and 12 seconds left, and a 30-minute timer with 26 minutes and 23 seconds left. Which timer would you like to cancel?""""The 30-minute timer."" I replied.""Fourth timer, 30 minutes, starting now.""----------------------------------------------------------------Although I have now figured out that I needed to say to Alexa ""clear all timers,"" frustrations like these and all the unwanted advertising are still making me want to just donate Alexa to charity.

What little usefulness it has is just a hook to make you pay for and become reliant on amazon music unlimited. Unless you swallow that bait it is a poor and inconvenient option. Even if you can find enough \u201cfree with Prime\u201d music that you want to listen to, it won\u2019t let you add more than 20 songs to a playlist. Any function that doesn\u2019t further Amazon\u2019s ability to sell you more stuff or subscribe to more stuff, is just ignored and unaddressed.\u201cWhole House Audio\u201d??? That\u2019s a joke. It won\u2019t let you play your own music from your phone on the \u201ceverywhere group\u201d. It won\u2019t let you play radio apps on the \u201ceverywhere group\u201d. It won\u2019t let you play audio books on the \u201ceverywhere group\u201d. It won\u2019t let you play the audio from a Bluetooth-connected TV on the \u201ceverywhere group\u201d. Basically it\u2019s a novelty item that is WAY oversold as a whole house audio solution. It is only \u201cwhole house audio\u201d for being tied to Amazon\u2019s pay streaming music.If music is playing on one unit, and you ask it to continue playing the music on the \u201ceverywhere group\u201d: First, it will tell you that you can\u2019t play music on the \u201ceverywhere group\u201d because music is already playing on another unit. But It\u2019s not playing on another unit. It is playing on the unit you are talking to. So it will force you to stop playing the music and then make a new music request to be played on the everywhere group. I have yet to be able to get it to continue playing the same music it was originally playing on the everywhere group. Continuity is awful (non-existent). Amazon is primarily concerned with selling you the unlimited subscription, instead of responding to a reasonably foreseeable request in a manner that enhances your listening continuity as you move around the house.Let\u2019s say you\u2019re getting ready in the morning and you want Alexa to tell you the news. Don\u2019t expect to able to move around from room to room because it will only play that news audio on one unit. Not on the everywhere group, or on another smaller group. If you move to a different room that has  another unit, your only option is to replay the news from the very beginning again and listen to what you have listened to already over again.None of these problems are beyond the technical ability of the Echo units. Some of the problems are intentionally created obstacles just to try to force you into paying for unlimited. Others problems remain unaddressed because they wouldn\u2019t help (or hurt) Amazon to sell you more \u201cstuff\u201d.So you\u2019ve spent a few hundred dollars on echo units for around your house? Good luck with that. Don\u2019t expect true whole house audio and don\u2019t expect them to work together as a group of units. All you did was purchase the \u201cgateway drug\u201d for Amazon\u2019s selling machine.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

Sound quality is great and having Zigbee built into the $99 dollar speaker (RIP Echo Plus) is great for my home light setup. The ONLY reason (and warning) that this Echo lost a star is when 2  of these Echos are paired as a home theater setup with a 4K fire stick or Cube the volume is horrendously low on streaming video. At max volume the echo was maybe 60-70% of what the Echo Plus setup was. Oddly music and any other skills volume is fine. I assume this is some weird issue in \u201csurround\u201d sound processing. Only way to make louder is to mess with EQ settings but then sound balance isn\u2019t great. I\u2019m positive a firmware update can fix this but extremely annoying that this is not equal to (or better) than the Echo Plus even though there is even one extra speaker in the new Echo.

I see that there\u2019s an adapted that you can purchase to gain that functionality for $40, but I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019d want to buy that as I suspect the 5th gen might come with that.

More seriously, though, if you have restricted mobility or you live alone, then this device could be a real time/effort saver if you have it hooked up to other devices in your home (e.g., lights, tv, wall thermometer). You should be aware that there is a trade off between your privacy and the detail of your personal experience. For example, Alexa will want access to your contacts if you use it for calling folks via your wifi (your internet connection). And, it wasn't so long ago that people were able to hear others' conversations and command history. BTW: This is information you can look up via your Amazon account. So, travel with caution and ask yourself whether voice commands are superior to the discretion of silently typing your searches (which are archived is a cloud unless you disable the feature). I'll update this review once I've had more experience with the device, but right now, it seems that an Apple iPad does pretty much the same things (with Siri) and video availability (though at a much greater cost).\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Maybe a half-moon shape or something that projects sound at all angles against a flat surface.  The full-size Echo has good Bass, so I didn't really want that bouncing off the walls- I live in an apartment.  I was one of the first pre-orders for the newest 4th gen Echo and assumed it would arrive on or near 10/22/2020, but I later learned it would not arrive for nearly a month.  The Best Buy near me had 2 in stock, so I bought both and transferred my old Echo to the kitchen.I read some of the earliest reviews, saying the voice recognition wasn't on par with the previous model- and I think I imagined that being true at first.  It seems to detect a very soft wake word 5-10-15 feet away.Appearance wise- I like it.  When viewed from the front, it appears to be a perfect sphere.I think the biggest improvement in sound quality will be for the smaller Dot.

I also prefer the 360\xb0 sound from the echo plus. after going back-and-forth I\u2019ve personally experienced the microphones on the echo plus pick up my voice better. in my opinion this new version just sounds a little bit louder with more bass even though they both have the exact same drivers with the exception of the new one having an extra tweeter which doesn\u2019t really make a difference in the sound. I actually had to turn down the bass just a little because it sounded a little... messy. i\u2019m not really sure why they completely changed the design and got rid of the 360\xb0 sound and made it a directional sound speaker instead. i\u2019m a little confused. One more thing I noticed about the new speaker is when the volume goes up the bass goes down which is very common for all these speakers and most Bluetooth speakers but it seems especially evident in this newest version of the echo. they could\u2019ve at least made the bluetooth option volume sync with your phone with this new version. and of course it wasn\u2019t compatible to pair with my echo plus for stereo. ok i\u2019m done.\n,,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I was still rocking the gen 1 pringles can Alexa and hockey puck echo dots.Back in the day I heard about how the echo plus and then the 3rd gen still didn\u2019t sound nearly as level or bassy as the first generation echo so I had been abstaining from upgrading for a while. But then the quality of the sound from the 4th gen had been one of the main features I had been hearing about so I finally decided it was time. And honestly on that front as well as the built in zigbee hub it delivers in spades. The 4th gen Echo is more than capable of shaking the entire bookshelf she\u2019s on with just the default audio settings.However, there is one extremely frustrating aspect to the 4th gen echo, coming from a 1st gen: microphone quality and her ability to recognize when she is being spoken to.My 1st gen echo was almost too sensitive. She would wake up for anything that even vaguely sounded like \u201cAlexa\u201d at any volume with close to any amount of room noise. I have an oscillating fan in my living room and she could hear me over that and the TV. The new 4th gen will basically refuse to hear me unless I turn the fan off and mute the TV. And when she does recognize that I\u2019m yelling ALEXA at her from 10 feet away, half the time she won\u2019t pick up on the command I speak next. I bought a new echo dot the same day as the full size echo and she has no such problems.

I find the sound to be very satisfying and full ranged.  Plus you can adjust the 3-band EQ (bass, midrange, treble) to your taste in the app.  The bass quality is quite good, but when you get to a party-time level, the speakers will pop, even with the bass set to center.  But even worse is any kind of hip-hop or anything with a deep bass beat -- they will it make it pop (crackle/distort,) even at fairly low volumes.  Also I have found Alexa to misunderstand me a few times, even though I was close to the Echo and speaking very clearly.  The number ""nine"" must be pronounced long and clear or you'll get ""that was incorrect"" (if you're playing a trivia game, for example.Overall, I like the Echo a lot, and enjoy it's rich sound.

I had two problems to solve; first, I have lost about half my hearing, and secondly, we were completely unable to control a full blown 5 speaker surround system  through our Fire Cube and TV despite help from several others and even the Fire experts at Amazon.The Echos were easy to install using the Alexa App on my iPhone. Once they connected to our Wi-Fi network, it took only a few minutes through the app to pair them to the Fire Cube to create a sound system. The sound is quite good considering the small size of the speakers. Perhaps not equal to high end stereo speakers, but better, and more adjustable than those in my Bose radio. I was surprised and really like the equalizer adjustments available in the app.We only use the Echos as the sound system for the TV and to listen to music once in a while - no shopping or asking questions, etc. At the sale price of $69 each, I find them to be a fair value for our needs.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

BUT Cancelling it was difficult because it mysterious vanished from my recent orders, which seems devious as it was supposed to be a free included item - but I am hoping I am refunded its full price.PROsI new I wanted this for Spotify playing so I paid more to get the better speaker, and as I can connect it via bluetooth to my TV Soundbar /Bass it even sounds better. So overall happy but in truth I am no sound expert /musicphile.CONs- If you don't have an American accent and you want to set it to yours, you apparently lose functionality in the US but its not clear on what functionality to make it an easy choice.- I have it announce my Calendar but it does it twice. You can set the reminders to only announce once but it doesn't work for the calendar integration - its really annoying.- I like to clear up and delete my history - don't see any need for Amazon to have it. But to delete Activity you have to delete each Activity card and its like two taps. Again really annoying.- I have noticed things mysterious turn themselves on and off since setting this up. Can't tell if it's Alexa or the apps running the connected items to it. I don't see anything in Alexa history to suggest its Alexa and I haven't investigated further. i.e Xbox and lights mysteriously turn on.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

First off I have echoes of all generations in my home.  Sound wise this is the second best of all. The early 1 st generation Echo has surprisingly the best sound of all.  As the echo price point decreased (279$ for early 1st gen, to 69$ now) so had the sound quality. I wall mounted this about 5 feet high and it produces whole room sound. This is possibly the loudest echo. Sound quality is good. Especially at the price point. The claim to be able to pair with fire TV and use as a speaker is awesome, I have not tried to do it yet. But that is something I have wanted, no need for a speaker bar. Not 360 degree sound but directional tweeters. I\u2019m not sure if my speakers are pointed the correct way but it sounds great on a wall mount. The claim to be able to pair with another 4th gen for stereo sound is also very interesting.

I have a rather large family / living room and the sound fills the entire area. I purchased the wall mount and it was easy to mount and hide the power cable. The mount allows the Echo to swivel so I can point it in the direction of the listener. A neat feature of the Echo that is not available in the Echo dot is a temperature sensor. It's still calibrating the temp so I haven't tested this as yet.

First, few things are shaped that way in your house so instead of blending, it stands out. Secondly it is significantly wider, so it takes up more room, and due to its fabric covering will end up collecting way more dust on its wider top surface area. The previous model had a hard plastic top where the buttons were and was therefore easy to dust. How do you dust fabric? I have vacuum it now? Finally, the lights are now no the bottom. As most folks sit these things on tables and desks with other items, it is FAR more difficult to see the lights than when they were mounted on the top of the cylinder.

Sound quality was good but not nearly as good as the Echo Plus. But it filled the bill for an Alexa device with Zigbee hub. I added it to the stable of Alexa-aware devices in our home.  It was good at voice recognition and provided internet radio streaming in yet another room in the house.Then, out of the blue, it stopped working. To be precise, it answered questions about weather and time, so it was connected to the internet. But when I asked it to ""play XXX [radio station ID]"" it echoed the command and nothing happened. I tried several radio stations with the same result. Strangely enough, it obeyed commands relayed to it from the smartphone Alexa app. I tried resetting it by interrupting the power. No help there. Then, the next day, it was behaving normally again with no further intervention on my part. I have not had any such behavior on any of the other 4 Alexa-aware devices.Does anyone have an idea of what could have caused this?\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

We have a total of 12 Echos, Echo Shows, & Echo Dots placed throughout our home and these are the worst when it comes to communication. 2 of them replaced Echo 3rd Gens, and another was an add on to an existing TV (with 4k firestick) for better sound and since adding them to our system, we have had nothing but problems with the wrong device answering us. None of the locations changed, these were just swapped in. We noticed that these ALL LAG, and must not have the same speaker configuration as the Echo 3rd Gens because Echos two rooms away will now answer before these devices will.They do sound GREAT when they work properly, but because we already had a functioning system throughout our house, and knew the capabilities, these were/are a HUGE let down.I have tried updating them to see if that helps, but it has not.As a stand alone device these might be great, but to a family that has been using Alexas since the beginning and keeps adding for functionality around the home, we find them more of a nuisance than a help. We end up yelling at poor Alexa more than it's worth.I will note also, one is being used and is hard wired into my work from home computer, and that one lags even more... I notice when I unplug the AUX cable it seems to pick up speed, but when it is plugged in via the AUX cable to my PC it lags and is very slow to respond which in turn has the wrong device answering most times.It has all become more frustrating than helpful.

Voice recognition is a 50/50 toss-up, and while it's better at accurately recognizing words and phrases than other AI assistants, it still misses enough that important information doesn't get added to your to-do list or shopping list.I use it the most for timers, calendar reminders, task reminders, and adding things to my to-do list and shopping list hands off. Timers and task reminders work great; calendar reminders are awesome, but for some reason everything gets repeated twice even after having it set in the app to only repeat reminders once. The to-do list and shopping list feature works, but the integrations between different apps are really poor (my to-do list lets me have a dumping ground list for tasks added through the Alexa, but I have to manually sort and tag them later), and the Alexa app's features aren't strong enough that I'd be comfortable switching my lists to its platform for the ease of integration.We have two smart lights from Geeni that we use with it, and every second or third time we try to operate them through voice commands, the command fails in some way - the Echo doesn't respond even after listening to your request, or it says ""okay"" but doesn't actually operate the light until a few minutes or few tries later.We tried connecting it to our Firestick, but it was so non-functional we had a better experience just keeping them separate. HBO would routinely crash, or the sound would cut off of HBO streams, when the Echo was the speaker for the firestick; and the process of re-connecting the Echo after this happens, and clearing the Firestick app cache and relaunching things, etc. made the process miserable and unworkable.The app is very slow and hard to navigate - the paths to different features are hard to find, and you have to retrace your steps a lot to complete multiple complex actions.The audio quality is excellent, and I love using it for sleep ambience and music. However, it's very annoying to have to hear ads interfering with the experience of virtually any Alexa app you'll use, whether that's a small soundscape service or a major music platform. The best experience I have is connecting it to my phone via Bluetooth so I can play whatever I want without interruption, which is a pain, but at least then I haven't just paid for an Amazon product that still makes me listen to ads.Also, the fact that staff will have to listen to voice recordings to improve the quality of the products or that your speech is stored in the cloud at all is a huge privacy issue.\n",14 people found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

I (we) have to repeat myself and/or yell if the music volume is too high.  I disagree with the others who say they don't like the sound.  I think (assuming you do mess with equalizer)  that you can find sound that is superior to the previous generation Amazon Speakers.  I also have a Sonos 1 and I think this speaker sounds as good as that one.  I do like the built in Zigbee Hub that allows me to control more smart devices. Every now and again the speaker groups/pairings get flubbed but cycling the power fixes that. Overall I am pleased.

Amazon Sells This to Convert People to Their Music Streaming Service!,"\nDo not buy this if you are using it with Apple Music. I'm confident it's a piece of garbage for Spotify users too. Echo is advertised to work with Apple Music. But you can only use Apple Music in specific ways.You cannot access your library! The only way to access songs in your library is by creating your own playlist. And that still does not give you access to a play a song in that playlist. You have to skip through the playlist to find the desired song. It doesn't let you play Recently Played or Recently Added either.You cannot tell Echo to play a song or an album you want to listen to! You cannot select songs or albums on your phone either. The app is bad in other ways. I wish I could just connect to bluetooth and use the Apple Music or Spotify app on my phone (like any other bluetooth speaker).DELAY is very long when using the app! Earlier today I pressed the skip button on my phone to change songs. I was able to have a short conversation with someone before the command was processed (or the song actually changed). No exaggeration. Usually the delay is shorter, but still about 5 seconds. That's still unacceptable and frustrating. You cannot skip songs without wasting lots of time.You can only tell Alexa to start the playlist, shuffle, and skip songs (waiting several seconds or sometimes minutes between songs).Volume buttons on my iPhone do not work while using Echo. I have to scroll the volume tab on the app, or use my voice to tell Alexa to quiet down. And, like switching songs, there is a LONG DELAY when you adjust volume! I found myself accidentally playing music way too loud and having to just deal with the pain and discomfort for several seconds. You cannot quickly adjust the volume!I have not been this disappointed and frustrated with a product. I am convinced this is Amazon's way of making people switch from Apple Music or Spotify to their music service. It probably works well with their streaming service. That must be why Echo is priced reasonably.Sound quality is ok for the price. It's louder than I expected. However, bass heavy music like Rap sounds distorted and generally poor. It is advertised as having ""deep bass."" Bass is really disappointing with this, even considering it's a small and affordable speaker. My smaller, lighter, wireless JBL speaker has more bass. The Echo gets much louder (with no bass).Alexa is sometimes bad at understanding commands. I said earlier, ""Alexa, play Recently Played playlist on Apple Music."" (I know this command cannot be done with the Echo.) However, instead of telling me this cannot be done, Alexa played some Apple Curated playlist that had nothing to do with my command. Music played that I don't like and I could not pause it for 5-10 seconds.All that being said, you'll be disappointed with this product. Disappointed is not a strong enough word through. This thing is intentionally designed by Amazon to frustrate people that use Apple Music and Spotify. I understand that Amazon is motivated by profit. However, profit should not come at the expense of making customers angry. This Echo was clearly built to make people so frustrated, so they switch to Amazon's music service. The majority of people use Apple Music and Spotify. They intentionally prohibit the most BASIC features so that you pay them instead of Apple or Spotify! I feel disrespected by Amazon.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

The microphone disabling is a nice feature with the ring light at the bottom letting you know whether or not Alexa will pick up your voice. As for the volume, it doesn't distort as much at higher volumes but there is still some if you go towards the maximum. Regarding voice recognition, it does much better at picking up my voice when playing Jeopardy! and trying to answer questions instead of constantly asking me to answer in the form of a question like who is or what is, which keeps the game flow going much smoother. This version is definitely faster to answer questions as well with upgraded components.

It's wider than my old Echo, & the material just collects dust... the whole device is truly a heinous monstrosity I can't wait to be rid of if/when they come out with another version that is no longer this shape or low quality.The only reason this gets 2 stars is because I like the thermostat feature & I got it on sale so I can't complain about its price (other than it's not worth sale price let alone full price)...

Speakers were great, whisper across the room and it heard me.  I've had the 4th gen for 3 months and absolutely hate it.  The speaker sounds great, but the microphones are terrible.  Pretty much defeats the purpose of having a smart speaker.  I have it sitting on my nightstand 6 to 10 inches from my head and it doesn't hear me.  I literally have to almost yell for it to do anything while lying in bed.  Standing up, I need to right up to it to have it respond to me.  I've reset, de-registered and re-registered, tried all the internet solutions and it still doesn't work.  There is definitely a flaw in the design or components.  Buyer beware, hopefully Amazon can fix the issues.  I am ready to throw this in the trash.***UPDATE: 10/5/22***Still having the same issues with the microphones not hearing me.  I've been contacted by Amazon Outreach Support for comments on my review.  They offered to replace the unit with a refurbished one, but I did not want one that someone else returned for possibly the same reason.The 4th gen has 4 microphones where as the 2nd gen I traded in had 7 microphones.  Why the reduction in microphones?  With my bedroom door open I can yell to my bedroom Echo, with out a response,  and I can hear the 2nd gen Echo downstairs in the living room respond.  It is actually comical at this point.  I no longer have to snooze the alarm since I fully wake up trying to get it to respond.  Something is definitely wrong with this design and lack of microphones.  I've been watching and waiting to see if an updated version is coming out, but still nothing.  Huge disappointment for a great device.We have a total of 7 Echo speakers in the house range from the cube to the dot, varying generations.  By far this is the best sounding, but it is also deaf at the same time.  I dabbled with the idea of replacing my home entertainment speakers with either 2 of these 4th gen and the sub-woofer or an Echo Studio and the sub-woofer, but none have been updated in years.  2020 for the 4th gen and 2019 for the Studio.  I hope new version come out of both speakers and I can make a few upgrades.Bottom line, if you have an older gen Echo and it suits your needs, wait for a better model to be released and skip the 4th gen.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

If you want a device that will actually do what it is supposed to without randomly just forgetting how to do things it was doing literally minutes before, don't waste your money on an Echo.I purchased the Echo to act as a room thermometer since I live in a state that does not feel that central heat and air is worth providing to peasants in apartments. Worked great out of the box, so I got a bunch of the light bulbs to go with it expecting that I was about to start setting up my smart home for the future. Within a few days most of the light blubs no longer responded to voice commands, or did respond but Alexa would tell me that it is not responding. Annoying, but as it was not the thing I bought this for, it was simply an annoyance.Then the thermometer stopped working. Rather than tell me there is an issue, or provide any semblance of help, Alexa just says this feature is not supported. Well, that of course is simply not correct, but Alexa will not help you with things, she simply is a robot voice with no ability to problem solve or even perform the most basic error checking that even Windows is finally good at. So there is no arguing with her, when she says it is not supported, boom, it simply does not work anymore.So I went through the hassle of trying to figure out how to get it working again. Finally found that by removing all of the groups and lights I had added and then reset the device, the one thing I bought it for will actually work again. Great! I cant use any of the other features it has or it will kill the thermometer, but hey $50 for a thermometer is a steal. Wait... indoor thermometers are way cheaper than that. Well shoot.I then got home this evening to find that even though I have none of the other features activated, the thermometer is again ""not supported"". I work in tech support so I understand that things will not always work right out of the box, and that is reasonable. For them to randomly break with no input from the user is just a sign of a poorly made and designed product. Honestly, Bezos has all of the money now so trying to provide feedback to Amazon at this point is useless. If you have never gotten to experience their customer service, try it sometime. It is eye opening. So rather than write them a long message they will never read, it is easier to just let all of yall know what to expect.It might work, it might not, but if it doesn't you are up the proverbial creek without a paddle. Quite honestly mine is a paperweight right now. At least it cant mess that up. Not happy, 0/10 would not recommend.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

My fearless 50lb Pit Bull became so afraid that she\u2019d hide behind my legs or behind the couch and was totally inconsolable. (Picture the behavior some dogs experience during thunderstorms) It took me about a week to figure out what was causing this once I realized there was a pattern. I researched my concern and found many other pet owners who experienced the same or similar thing with their pets after buying the echo...It seems there is a high frequency sound being emitted that only dogs can hear. I was going to return my device but once I realized the problem stopped after unplugging it, I decided to move it away from the kitchen into the living room to give it one more shot. The problem is gone now. Unfortunately, it was so traumatic to my dog that she still runs out of the kitchen every time I turn the toaster on :(\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

The Echo is good at the basics (turn lights on/off at X time) and makes a good stepping stone for beginners because once you advance to needing a true smart home hub, you will still want the Echo around to manage voice controls so it doesn't necessarily become obsolete in your home. I think this is pretty clear, but to reiterate: the hub is only zigbee compatible, not z-wave. The quality of the speaker is on par or a bit better than my Bose Sound Link Color (and is way better sounding than the Echo Dot) and easily connects with my iPhone to play music so again - good middle of the road option. The Echo seems to accomplish the smart home hub and speaker tasks very well for this price point (I purchased on sale for $70). If you are not interested in the smart home hub or the upgraded speaker, go with the Echo dot - the voice assistant features are identical.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Although it is good audio for its size and price. I was expecting a little more, but that may just be my fault. It's also smaller than I was expecting. Really curious how much smaller the dot version is.The echo 4th gen does sound nice overall and is probably good enough for most people.Voice recognition works well.Zigbee works well enough for the limited amount of smart home devices i have.Setup was a little weird because it didn't recognize during set up the first time, but I just exited the app and restarted setup process and it worked fine the 2nd time without issues.I'd recommend this for those who are getting their first smart home device like I was, especially if it's on sale.

They are solid units, but fall short in the following ways:1) Voice recognition not as good as previous generations. There are times when I attempt to wake the device up and have to shout. I was able to wake the other devices up with more of a conversational tone. There are also times when it doesn't appear to be able to process what I said, so it will just disregard everything and not say anything.2) The speaker is good, but I can see why others have complained about it not being 360. One of my devices is placed facing the dining area. When I am in the kitchen, the music does not sound as good since it is facing away from me. This was not an issue with the 2nd generation is previously replaced.3) Not a big deal, but it would be nice if they sent out a darker cord with the dark colored units. They did this previously.In the end, if your device needs to be replaced or you don't currently have one, then this is a solid device. If you have a 2nd generation (or higher), then maybe skip this one.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

The bass is heavier in this unit than in previous versions which is a welcome change. The sound is crisp enough to fill a small room. It still won't replace high-end audiophile systems, but this is a step in the right direction.No longer do you need to invest in the Echo Plus to get the premium features of a Zigbee hub and built-in thermometer. These are now standard in the fourth-gen Echo.Because of the shape, Amazon has been forced to put the lighting at the bottom of the device so this may influence the decision on where to place it. The major flaw in the aesthetics is the white power cable that comes with the charcoal version of the Echo. I'm not sure if that's a fluke or if Amazon is following in the missteps of Samsung and making the colors different on purpose.

It is our 3rd sound device to go along with a couple Alexa plugs.  We expected a decidedly improved sound with this device. But, while it does in fact provide you with a bit deeper sound and tone quality, I am not sure that the difference between this and the small Dot devices that we had justifies the price difference.

For the old one, to get good sound we had it connected to a sound bar which is also connected to a TV we have on the patio wall.  The new Echo has a great look, in my opinion, and we bought a swivel wall mount and mounted it on the patio wall near an outlet and it works great.  The speakers are much better than the old Echo so we don't have to have it connected to the sound bar.  The sound is really good coming from the unit itself.We have lots of things that we control via our Echo devices - lights, roller shades, water fountain, robot vacuum, TV, etc., and as soon as I added this new Echo to the devices via the Alexa app it was seamless.

The globe shape takes up more space in every instance where it's put than its cylindrical predecessors2.  The internal temperature sensor is often inaccurate.  Apparently it updates no more often than every 30 minutes.3.  The buggy alexa app occasionally shows the echo 4 temperature on its status screen, but most of the time it doesn't display -- the temperature line is missing. Previous versions prominently displayed the temperature.4.  The temperature measures in C despite setting it to F in the alexa app.  The only way to change it is through a voice command to the echo.5.  Sound quality is markedly worse -- and is especially directional. Vocals are muffled and no amount of adjustment makes much difference.6.  The ""equalizer"" is still profoundly primitive with only three adjustment -- bass (which is already too heavy even at the lowest setting); midrange; and treble.7.  No digital signal processing?  This is 2021, not 2001.8.  The on-board processor(s) are very slow to react to commands -- and it's not related to the internet or WiFi.9.  Room speaker groups don't work -- one of the three speakers in the group will work fine and any of the three will work fine, but when asked to play in a group, two of the three speakers behave as if they have poor connections with glitchy sound that then drops in and out.  All are on the same WiFi dedicated network, and I've reset them multiple times.10.  The action light ring on the bottom is hard to see and is largely hidden by the globular shape.  The action ring is on in my image with a waiting notification -- can you see it?  Me neither.11.  There is some sort of sound-based occupancy sensor in this version of the echo -- again, doesn't work reliably, poorly documented; and poorly implemented and integrated with the buggy alexa app.12.  Still no way to interact with the echo devices using a web browser -- forced to use the buggy app.13.  Volume normalization across feeds is abominable.  Some sources, BBC World Service, for example are quiet -- others, such as the NPR feed are loud.  This should be tested before feeds are allowed to go live.  Even better, sound normalization should be automated in the cloud if not on the device.  It's maddening to be required to manually adjust the volume on EVERY SINGLE source!To say I am disappointed in these $100 duds is an understatement.I will be returning these ASAP.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

This makes it feel more like a diy tinkering toy and less like a premium product.My device still plays music from routines so I know it is connected to the internet so this is just an Amazon issue. Very disappointing. I wish I had stuck with google or tried apple\u2019s offering instead.Another issue I\u2019ve found, this device consistently asks me if I want to hear about products. I want my smart home device to control my smart home, not shove marketing down my throat.Updated 2x: the device has not given me any more issues. The mic is so sensitive it hears commands coming from downstairs or even when I whisper the A word. The sound quality is muddy but becomes \u201cnormal\u201d when you turn down the bass setting as low as possible. This makes the device sound very good. This is a great upgrade over a dot to the point where I actually enjoy listening to music on it.If you want an alexa device and don\u2019t want to spend $200 for the studio this is the one to get.I only wish they added that light up clock on this one, then It would be perfect for me.Updated: last time I unplugged and plugged back in this device seemed to do the trick fixing the microphone sensitivity for the last week.We will see how long it lasts before I need to do this againI needed to upgrade because the echo 1 I was using had an issue where the speaker would short out so you had to unplug it and plug it back in to get the sound to work.In terms of sound and voice recognition this device is not a huge upgrade compared to the first gen echo.This device is just as good as the original with some added features like a thermometer and sonic detection and a 3.5mm out/in so you can use it as a speaker or use other speakers with it.Why this device gets 1 star is for some reason when the device has been plugged in for awhile it will stop hearing the wake word. I am unsure if it is a power saving setting or a wifi setting but the device just does not listen. The only way to fix it is to unplug and plug the device back in.This was the main reason I needed a new device in the first place so you can see how satisfied I am with the new echo.Will update the review if they fix it, until then I\u2019ll keep using my google home mini instead\n",2 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I've tried connecting via good quality cables to various external systems, including some very high end amp and speakers, and the output level from the Echo is just too low, such that even the best, lowest signal to noise ratio units have a hard time amplifying the signal to a loud enough level without introducing noise and other artifacts.

Last night I ask her to play Klove radio station for me. She said I needed to get Amazons music service.  Told her to stop and tried again. She wanted to play Christmas music.  Told her to stop. Ask her what the temperature would be and she started to play Christmas music. Took her out of service. Ask my echo show to play klove for 30 minutes. Her answer was ""playing klove fromm H..... I heart radio for 30 minutes.""I think Amazon had different clouds for different echos. I have my dots be down but my show5 works fine. My dots don't argue we me like this echo does and this on is always trying to get me to buy things, a lot more than dots and shows does.Original post: I have echos from the very first one to now including echo show 5.  The sound quality is the best of all.  This new one (4th generation) has problem of hearing you and understanding you. I almost have to yell to get her to hear me and then she doesn't understand. Example. I have lights with wifi bulbs (2 different brands)  I almost always have to tell her twice to turn on or off. I have a Amazon smart plug and the same.  easy to set up and easy to get other products to work with her.Update:  I\u2019ve changed my post from 3 Stars to 1. She\u2019s getting more hard of hearing. She went bonkers the other night and could only do a few commands. She kept telling me that she could not connect to the internet. All others were okay. I finally unplugged her then restarted. She then told me she needed to recalibrate. That\u2019s a new one.Update: less than a hour after posting the update Amazon customer services called and worked through the problem. The wakeup name Alexa is a corrupted file. Changing to echo made it better.  We will see if that holds. Change from 3 stars to one. Will move It to 2 stars. If it holds i will change ratings to 3 or higher.UPDATE September 30 2021:I\u2019m going to go back to one star. Her hearing problem is getting worse. She now argues with me. I tell her to turn on plug for porch and she gives ne the definition of a porch. I must tell her two times to turn on porch. She then tells me the porch is not a command. Go to another echo same command and porch comes on.I\u2019ve decided to remove her and put in my old first generation puck in her place. It\u2019s does not miss a command.After reading all the reviews about her hard of hearing I ordered anyway. My advice is don\u2019t buy this one.For information the command to turn on porch was at 4:00 am nothing was on in room to distract her.

And updated again.","\nThe speaker works well in a large room and we like the looks and color (blue), even though the cord is white. However, the Alexa apt is frustrating and has been since my first Echo Dot (original generation). Then, there's the Amazon Music Unlimited, which you would think would work great with the Amazon Alexa AND the Amazon Echo speakers. Well, I don't know which to blame, but here is an example: I paired my new 4th Generation Echo with my existing 1st gen. Echo Dot (in another room via the Alexa apt), then requested  an artist playlist (i.e. ""play music by Neil Diamond"") and they both worked - for a while. Then, after about six hours (which included Christmas music in March) the gen 4 Echo (mid-song) shut off while the old Echo Dot kept playing. Trying to correct the situation means: Stop Alexa, wait a while, then start over, if you're still inclined. This happens All the time when leaving on long enough. The sound volume also varies song-to-song so that I frequently manually turn the sound up or down. The sound quality is surprisingly good, otherwise. Alexa voice recognition, even after a substantial break-in period is ify: sometimes when requesting a playlist or song Alexa will want to sell me a book.Some artists play for hours and some for an hour, even though they have many more songs to their credit (i.e. Bill Medley played for one hour with three repeats of ""The Time of Our Lives""). If you have a lot of patience, have fun, but, sooner-or-later things get frustrating.Update: After contacting Amazon, a very helpful customer rep. guided me through a Factory Reset. Afterwards she promised the device would work 'perfectly'. It works worse. Now about tree hours both 4th Gen. Echo's hiss during playback then shut down with my original 1st Gen. Echo Dot still playing (on my 'everywhere' group inside our house). Then it took 6-7 attempts to get my old Echo Dot to stop. Before I purchased the two 4th Gen. Echo's, everything worked fine .. not 'perfectly', but fine. Good Luck! IF you buy these .. Still not sure if the problem is the new Echo's or Amazon Music Unlimited. Another update (4-20-21): While we do enjoy Amazon Music (when it works) and the sound is good .. the Echo is in a large room so I decided to add another for stereo and coverage .. call me stupid for still hoping for a good experience .. what convinced me to buy another (?) .. Amazon put it on sale and promised to include a free smart plug .. well, Amazon came through again and didn't include the smart plug and their customer service can't remedy. At least I got the sale price, but, I am increasingly NOT becoming a loyal Amazon customer. 6/10/21 Update: Alexa Sucks!: Frequently doesn't play what you ask for, or, when it does, stops playing, mid-song, when it wants, then freezes so you can't play any music until ""SHE"" feels like it (even doing a 'unplug' restart doesn't help). These speakers are marketed for Alexa and Amazon Music users and the experience (six months worth) is frustrating, maddening, and just plain bad.\n",5 people found this helpful,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

I don't want to return it but I need it to work and now she is not responding, and when she does respond there is terrible feedback noise.Pluses:+ acts as hub+ color good+ design goodCons:- it often doesn't understand my voice from nearby and I have to ""shout"" or ""sternly"" give commands- the volume up or down doesn't always take affect and you have to repeat the command- the sound now started to get crackly and play static feedback with it - has started to ""ignore me"" and it will ligt up blue, i will say ""play jazz music"" and it doesn't do anything- i have a dot in a room nearby (but not close), and the dot will often pick up my voice in the enxt room, even though i am on the sofa sitting directly next to the hub one and the hub will not respond----update on review:amazon customer service did try to help. they are sending me a replacement one to see if it is a hardware issue on this specific device that i got. crossing fingers the new one is better.i did speak with the rep about the difference in amazon plus. vs. studio vs. 4th geninteresting to me that the echo plus 2 are still more expensive than the new 4th gen even though they are ""older"" technology.i suspect the plus 2 have the kinks worked out, wish the price would drop.and maybe some of these issues with my new 4th gen device are teething issues with it being a ""new and improved"" design and inner-parts.also an odd note on the customer service - the team that followe dup on a 2star review, they rang me and i asked to call back later. he mentioned he would email me - got the email, the instructinos said ""you can reply directly to this email"" so I took the time to reply to the email but then got the automatic response that said ""you are writing to an email that no longer accepts incoming messages"" s - so he won't see my response and the alternate contact path is to log a new ticket, which i've already done so i wont resend.\n",One person found this helpful,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

Initially when pairing with your Philips Hue bulbs it would work but once you move them, Alexa stops detecting them. I tried resetting the bulb with its code but that didn't work though the bulb flickered for a second. To fix the issue I had to reset Alexa back to set up mode and pair the light bulbs again by resetting it with its code. Another issue was that sometimes Alexa would not play the audio from my laptop though it was connected. When I try to disconnect or forget my laptop device on the Alexa app it would give me errors or won't disconnect/ forget.

It's spherical look matched the look of the spherical lamps in my living room (Ikea Fodo lamps), purchasing with the intent of moving my Echo Plus to a different room in exchange for this new model being the living room's device.Right away I noticed the sound pickup is weaker than my Echo Plus. Having used the Plus for nearly three years in the same location, I was accustomed to a specific level of voice pickup, especially when first entering my home and prompting Alexa to turn on the lights. This new model needs me to speak much louder to throw my voice enough in order for it to pickup and respond accordingly. That's strike one.Next, while I love the design and the light ring makes sense at the base for this design, I decided very early on that the placement of the light ring at the base is counterintuitive as it's difficult to impossible to see if your prompt was recognized if your vantage point is obstructed; this was not the case with the Echo Plus with it's tall cylindrical design. That's strike two.Finally, the sound quality. Thinking it would sound better than the Echo Plus was logical given the Plus model is several years old and this new model boasts more size to house a decent speaker system. Modern audio devices have really stepped up their game with rich sound and deep bass, so I assumed this would perform exceptionally. Unfortunately, I found the audio quality to fall below that of the Echo Plus. I linked all my echo devices so that music will play across all the devices to fill my home. Walking from my living room (where this new Echo lives) into my art studio (where the Echo Plus was moved to) there is an undeniable difference in sound quality, with the Echo Plus clearly being the superior in sound. This new model suffers by not adopting the 360 sound of the Plus and also sounds to have weaker bass in comparison, even after matching the audio settings to the Plus. That's strike three, which is three strikes too many.My final analysis is that this new Echo isn't much more than a larger Echo Dot with the added benefit of the hub that allows integration with Hue bulbs.I will be placing my Echo Plus back into the living room and redesignating this new model as an Auxiliary device in another part of my home. I may purchase a better quality external sound system for it, but in any case, Amazon needs to revisit the Echo with more focus on sound than the physical design because I feel some sacrifices were made to make a product look pretty.\n",4 people found this helpful,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

But all this just increases my disappointment when Alexa just doesn't seem to get what I am requesting, even when I am taking great care to be very clear. Even worse is when Alexa appears to go on strike and just not respond to my requests at all. I dread hearing her frequent plaint, ""I'm sorry. I'm not understanding right now. Try again later."" In addition to these complaints, I have to add that Amazon is still far from the top of its game when it comes to the sound quality of its Echo devices--at least this one. If Amazon is going to tout ""premium sound,"" it should certainly do better. When Alexa speaks, she sounds as if her face is buried in a pillow, and music is by no means crisp, clear, or well balanced. What bass response there is does not make up for imbalances over the rest of the frequency range, which Alexa's equalizer function seems unable to adequately adjust.

Now I just added two Echo 4th gens in my home office.  I have them at opposite sides of my desk and successfully grouped them, and added a Home Theater setup to connect with my FireTV over my desk.  The sound quality is amazing - deep base - and some added unexpected perks with lyrics showing up on the FireTV when I stream music.  I also love using the Theater sound instead of my crappy TV speakers (old 42"" flat panel with nice picture, but poor sound).  Now my movies sound so much better!  The FireTV remote even picks up volume control now on the Echo's too.

I was contacted by customer service and told this issue was being resolved and after a few days it seemed to be,  although i had to recreate my playlists for it to work.  Now, its back to not playing my actual playlist, of music i purchased, but rather plays random music the system deems similar.  I have moved to spotify and will cease buying my music from amazon and will be setting up a system that does not rely on amazon music or the echo devices as it is just too frustrating. Granted amazon already got my money, but they will get no more and i will warn anyone who will listen. It should not be this difficult to play a playlist of music ive prchased. Frankly, i think it's all part of the pressure to force one to subscribe to unlimited, even to access music one has already purchased and it's just wrong. All I wanted was a way to play music.  Alexa has a decent speaket for my purposes and I figure it will work well with my Prime Music.  Ha.  I've never been able to get Alexa (or Echo) to reliably play a playlist without a big hassle.  I took to setting up routines to get the device to play the right playlist.  But now it won't even do that.  Now Alexa will play my playlist - the same one it's played for 3 months - on ""shuffle and similar song"" mode.  I mean, if I wanted random music I'd ask for that and not ask for a playlist.  When I ask to turn off shuffle mode Alexa says it can't.  I checked my prime music and it is NOT on any kind of auto shuffle mode that I can see.  Going with Alexa for music has been a mistake. A device that is supposed to make life easier has been a constant source of frustration and now a complete fail for the purpose I bought it.  I can't imagine how frustrating it must be if you want to do anything more challenging than playing a music playlist.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

Good base for it's size, and very clear mid range.  I upgraded from the first edition Echo to connect it to my new Fire TV.  It was easy to connect and pair through the Alexa app, and the sound is significantly better.  I did not listen to both side by side, but believe the sound is improved in mid range.  And for my needs, I prefer the directional vs. 360 degree sound.  I did like the smaller footprint of the older models, but this looks nicer mounted to the wall next to my TV or in a living room.  It  is also perfect to bring outside.  The voice recognition is excellent, except at very high volumes, you have to get close and scream.  I read the noise filtering is better on the Echo Studio, which is a much better for blasting music.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I have the new-gen 4 to replace Gen 3 so it would have the hub.  The hub part works great.  However, when I am in the kitchen and the device is so close to me (same position as older model)  I have to yell at Alexa and wait (note; no music or anything playing) then speak the command.  In previous-gen versions, I have been able to talk at a normal volume and pace and Alexa picks up what I am saying right away.Now 1 of 2 things happen 1. I have to pause for 3 -4 seconds after saying Alex or it simply does not respond OR 2. the echo dot device in another room picks up the request and plays the response in that room.Also while it looks super nice compared to other models, the light indicator being at the bottom is almost useless.  If I have a notification I can't see the light , where when the light was at the top of the device you could see the light from a distance.  Now it's just hidden and pretty useless if you are not right on top of the unit.Also playing music on this is not nearly as loud or pronounced as previous gen models.  This sounds muted (so does the dot 4th gen) , sadly I feel like this 4th gen went down hill and not much able to be done about it if you're a alexa ecosystem. household\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Over a year later I think that is not realistic.I have had intermittent problems with this device since the beginning. The issues are sporadic and the only technical assistance that has ever been provided was unplug it and plug it back in. There have been a myriad of defects ranging in seriousness from not responding or responding completely off basis, to randomly changing my sleep sounds to running water throwing me into panic in the middle of the night, continued to blare my alarm after it had been disarmed, or refusing to disarm my alarm clock in the morning. Not an issue if you are good with unplugging an plugging in your ""hands free device"". I have read about similar issues with this model and I have friends that have had similar issues with this model. I need to return it but I keep hoping it is a software issue they will eventually work out.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Hyde,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on October 20, 2021","Worked For Years, but Not Anymore.","\nI've had many Echo devices starting with my first when I was invited to buy a 1st gen before they went to market. I currently have 2 Echo Shows, 2 4th gen Echos, 2 Echo Dots and an Echo Auto. We've always like the Echo products...until recently. About a month ago, we went to bed and as usual  told Alexa to play our SleepyTime playlist. Sometime in the night, she stopped playing and when we tried to get the playlist going again she said she couldn't reach the internet. When I woke up the next morning, I found our internet was fine so I tried reconnecting the Echo. No matter what I tried, she would not connect. If I asked her a question, she would just reply with ""I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. The internet is not reachable. ""I even did a factory reset - still no good. Thinking it was bad, I went to Best Buy and bought another 4th gen Echo. It too too would not connect. I tried over and over - no good.  So, for kicks, I decided to use my wife's phone and her Amazon account and in the first attempt the device connected. To eliminate my phone as a problem. I opened a brand new Fire Tablet registered to me. I first updated the Alexa app and attempted to connect the 4th gen Echo to my account - no good. We've done coutless resets, but nothing works with my account. Her account, no problem. I have taken the Echo to my work and it does the same thing there as well. The problem with using my wife's account is that all of the other devices, Kasa plugs, Hue lights etc., are attached to my account. I had bought a pack of 4 Kasa plugs and they cannot attach to my account either. I can use them within the Kasa app, but cannot attach them to my Alexa account. Basically, my account is somehow damaged. I called tech support after about 10 days of trying to fix this myself. I was hung-up on twice, but eventually got someone in Echo tech support. After trying many things, even screen sharing from the new Fire tablet, the technician said that this was very unusual and should not be behaving like this. The devices register on my account, but they just won't work. She told me she and her team would need time to  investigate this issue and asked me for a good callback time for the next day. I said 5:30pm would be good. I never got the call and my devices still are not working. Through my efforts, I have eliminated my network, my phone, my tablet, the Alexa app, the Echo devices- everything but my Alexa account. I have no choice at this point but to give them a one star review until this is fixed.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

Not crisp, clean, clear.* BUILT-IN ZIGBEE HUB:  after unplugging the Echo (or after a power outage) Zigbee devices get disconnected and do not automatically reconnect.  It is a huge pain to have to reset and reconnect each device and redo any routines that used those devices.  I also worry about the safety and security of a smart home when devices like heaters, humidifiers, alarms, etc no longer talk to the hub or follow automated commands after after a power outage.  Hopefully this is something that Amazon can fix with a Echo software update.* TEMP SENSOR: I like that there is a temperature sensor, but unlike a standalone Zigbee temperature sensor, the temperature reading from the Echo doesn't show up when I add the Echo to the Favorites section of the Devices page in the Alexa app.  It should.  Seems fixable with an Alexa app update.* FORM FACTOR:  The spherical shape may work for smaller Echo Dots, but in the larger Echo it is not appealing.  In my room it sticks out like a sore thumb.

With the Prime day sale, I purchased two of them and set them up as a stereo pair. It works well with Amazon music, but has limitations when trying to stream music to the Echo pair over Bluetooth or using the AUX in connector.  Either of those methods only steam the music to whichever echo is connected by Bluetooth or AUX, not to the second paired Echo.  I suppose this doesn't matter that much if you use Amazon Music Unlimited, but if you have an extensive music collection with playlists, or other good reason to want to use Bluetooth or AUX IN to play media, then you are only able to do it with one of your Echos.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

The sound quality was worse and had a hollow tone. You could correct a little with the app but never got to the quality of the original we had.Another big factor for our change was the mic on our 1st gen just wasn\u2019t as responsive after all these years and we found ourselves always yelling at Alexa. However, when we set up this new Gen 4 Echo we found it performed worse than the original. So much so, that the Gen 4 sphere would ignore our commands while the G1 which we moved to a further room away was still picking up our commands.  I\u2019d fault a good bit of this to placement location of the two units, as it\u2019s a little close to a tv but I\u2019m doing an apples to apples comparison of the two different units in the same spot under the same lifestyle home conditions.  We gave it about 14 days of testing before we gave up and decided to return.Also, I\u2019m not sure the spherical design is really any better stylistically or practically. It seems to take up more space and having the light ring on the bottom means you can\u2019t really tell when Alexa is actually hearing your commands.  We ended up repeating ourselves quite often because she just wasn\u2019t acknowledging we were speaking to her. Plus from a volume control standpoint the ring can no longer provide a visual queue as you can\u2019t see all the way around the sphere. Obviously you can ask Alexa what her setting is volume wise, but sometimes you just want to see.Lastly, we bought a blue one. It\u2019s neat that it\u2019s not black like all of our other echoes and dots. But, the exact shade of blue actually wasn\u2019t that appealing once we had it in our house.  It\u2019s almost like they couldn\u2019t decide which shade of blue to use so they just went with blah in the end.Biggest Pro:  I like the idea of the new colors.Biggest Cons: sound quality and mic sensitivityExtra note - we did link it with the multi room sound playback and that feature was easy enough to set up and integrated our G1 Echo with this G4 Echo seamlessly.  It also pointed out more sound flaws though as the G1 outperformed in the end with providing a more dynamic and balanced room filling sound.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

I love music and the quality on this device is pretty great. I can even have all of my alexa devices play the same music in the house or different songs in different rooms. I also time the device to play sleep music for 20 mins at bedtime. She does all commands other Alexa devices recognize.  I would say the only downfall is that it does not have the built in clock that the echo dot has (dot is smaller and not as rich in music quality) I can ask the time but it isn't displayed.

This easily fills a quiet garage, but will be pushed if there are louder garage sounds. The sound quality isn't really super high quality, it's more room filling for the size. That's all I need in that environment. I do particularly care about good sound quality in general, so I might be more critical than most. Not being a sound snob, just saying most will fine the sound quality perfectly fine, so YMMV. I like that the new design is more directional. The older designs were omni directional which doesn't make much sense unless your speaker is in the middle of a room. Most place them closer to a wall, so this has more precise, less muddy sound. A small little detail on this speaker that scores points with me is the standard speaker mounting hole.

A single source, stereo, even 360 degree, it just isn't happening with any Echo, Hype.Just ok sound, connectivity if not easily paired or set up, an Echo may fit your needs. Or your childs. Setting up multiple Echos for stereo pairs, the message I get, ""this device is not compatible, the proceed further ""next"", grayed out. With the Echo or the Echo Studio. But perhaps that's just me.UPDATE: HERE'S WHY I COULDN'T SET UP STEREO PAIRS between an Echo and my Studio. After a very polite and in one way helpful call(helped me set up a temp sensor Routine) with a very knowledgable Amazon tech support(thanks Chris L) about connecting Echos, Echo Studio in stereo pairs,""ONLY ALLOWS STEREO PAIRS OF LIKE DEVICES"". MEANING: NOT AN ECHO AND A STUDIO. NOT AN ECHO DOT AND AN ECHO. NOT AN ECHO STUDIO WITH AN ECHO.... LIKE DEVICES, EXACTLY. YOU CAN SET UP MULTI ROOM DEVICES THAT WILL THEN PLAY TOGETHER, NOT IN STEREO PAIRS.I'm told.WHAAAAAAT?????Temperature Sensor- a big reason to buy but it just doesn't perform, react to changes in temp fast enough to make this feature worth while. The sensor being ""in"" the Echo enclosure is heavily influenced by the enclosure temp itself(and everything inside). A big/rapid change in temp? the enclosure keeps the Echo from implementing in real time. Have a heater connected? Think this is great to turn on/off by temp? Very slow to respond to either a temp drop in the room(then it turns on the heater in a created routine) and then responds very slowly to turn the heater off when ""off"" routine temp is reached. Seems to me this is a case of an external temp sensor, not in the Echo enclosure would work much better. I tried it, just toooo slow to respond and I deleted the routines.\n",9 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Its response is to direct us to enable ""youtube"" by using the Alexa app.  At the Alexa app, there isn't a method to solve this problem.

I know this both by the feel of the room temperature and because I placed a digital thermometer six inches from the device.  Because of this inconsistency, I couldn't even just manually include an offset for my purposes (a window AC unit plugged into an IoT plug with automations to turn it on/off based on the temperature reading off the sensor).Thinking the first one was just a defective unit, I was sent a replacement... which has the exact same issue.  Clearly the sensor in this generation is just flawed and therefore should not be purchased if you plan to use the temperature readings for anything other than a very rough estimate.Everything else about the device works as-expected and it is a very cool looking unit.If I hadn't bought this specifically for the temperature sensor, I'd probably have given it four stars.

I constantly get \u201cx device doesn\u2019t support that\u201d followed by the command being carried out the next time I say it.  It integrates horribly with my firetv stick (so did the previous generation) where \u201claunch Hulu on firetv\u201d gives me a 50/50 split of \u201cthat skill is not enabled\u201d and \u201claunching Hulu on firetv\u201d.I have 3 alexas in 3 different rooms spanning about 2000 square feet.  The microphones are too good so more often than not 2/3 of them hear the wake word and (I guess?) assume the other one will follow out the command so neither does it.  The new Alexa asked me yesterday if I was talking to it or a different Alexa.  I corrected it but it hasn\u2019t helped anything.The only positive here is that when it gets a command right, specifically with SmartThings, it is a little faster.Our echo does not sit directly under the tv.  It would be neat if the echo would work for as read sound or atmos sound for your tv.  It does not.  It will only work as a tv speaker with our firetv stick which means the sound comes out from a weird place in our room.*****Update****. It\u2019s garbage.  I have to yell for it to hear me and when it does, it ignores my command or gets it completely wrong;  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, X device doesn\u2019t support that\u201d randomly only to work perfectly the next time.  The microphone is worse than the firetv cubes by 10.  The old microphone was so much better.  If I could return this I would.  If you want better sound get an Echo Studio or SONOS instead.Update 2: If I wasn\u2019t so lazy I\u2019d go find our old one in the basement.  This thing doesn\u2019t hear me, ignores me\u2026seems to hear me then ignores me.  What the heck happened here?  Who thought this was a good idea?  How is this 5 stars?Space heaters and fans defeat this. Worried about Alexa hearing your conversations? Just turn on your ceiling fan or a space heater.

Not sure the rest is an improvement.,"\nCombined this with the battery base, and the two seem to work very well together for moving into the yard.  I'm not sure that the sound is any better, or even equal, to the previous Echo versions.  The unit certainly isn't as responsive to voice commands.  Where the other units responded quickly, with this one we have to raise our voices, get closer, and often repeat the wake command before it responds.  Altogether a mixed review as to whether this is an advancement, or a step back.  Not sure what Amazon was doing here.  Doesn't seem to have been a leap forward in any way.  Just an upsell.  But we fell for it, for the portability factor (which used to be satisfied by the Tap, which is no longer supported -- hmmmm).  Make your own judgements.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

I don't claim to be an audiophile but the sound does seem crisper and a little deeper. I also find that it's picking up my voice a little better than the older model. Obviously I love having the Echo for all the usual reasons... Easy to stream music from multiple services; reminders REALLY help to fill in the blanks of my poor memory; routines are pretty easy to create - and useful - once you get the hang of it.

Sound is significantly improved, which was the primary reason for purchasing.  The Unit is on a living room end table and I notice that when I crouch down to the level of the Echo, the treble is much crisper.  I think the two treble speakers should have been placed higher so that they could emit sound more vertically.  This is my only negative comment about the unit.  Everything else is similar to the Dot it replaced and seems to work as expected.  If you're not as picky as I am about the sound, I think you will thoroughly enjoy this product.

Not terrible, but you will have moments that it doesnt catch quite what you say, but if you get into the habit of practicing annunciation a bit it gets better. Love that it connects to my Spotify. Also makes using smart home products easy and fun. For sure its alot bigger than you expect, but not oversized. One con I would say for me is i wish the buttons were closer to the front, but thats where the speakers are. maybe a bigger base with an edge that slants out forward in the front or something.

She was very kind and friendly so this update has nothing to do with her. I am returning here to change my two star review to a one star review because I am so frustrated that this echo does not understand me most of the time, responds when I don\u2019t ask for a response, and most importantly does not always respond when I do ask for a response. I really really hate this version and so very much regret trading in my beloved 1st GEN Echo.1. My echo is gray/black and comes with a white cord that sticks out like a sore thumb making my countertop look messy.  Design fail.2.  This echo has a sense of urgency that is irritating.  I get it Echo, my timer is going off, but please give me time to actually respond to you before you tell me again.3.  This echo cannot hear or understand me as well as my 1st Gen.4.  This echo doesn't always give me the option to continue speaking. It's a hit or miss.5.  Sometimes responds, sometimes doesn't, even though I'm close.  Makes me yell at it out of frustration and I don't like that.6.  The I'm listening ""ding"" is way too loud considering my volume setting for the voice.7.  My 1st gen Dot performs better than this 4th gen Echo.  No way I'm getting rid of my Dot for this major design fail.I regret ""upgrading"" from my loved 1st gen to this 4th gen.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Is it a high end speaker? No. Is it better than the 2nd generation that's been collecting dust for X amount of years that it replaced? Definitely. This gives music a much richer sound that previous models can't compare to. The best feature IMHO is the addition of smart home integration directly into the hardware. I have quite a few older pieces of equipment that connect through an aging smarthome bridge that gives me trouble if the power is out for too long.

Out of the box it was too strong, and highs too muddled. But I turned bass wayy down and treble way up (but not all the way up which I usually have to do with cheaper speakers) and now it's great. Even turned down the bass is still rich and smooth, the sign of a good woofer. The size is a bit awkward but I think that's necessary to get that woofer in there...and also I like that it's less tall that the old echo because it doesn't block a secondary monitor that I have off to the side on my desk.

I bought the device to replace my 2nd generation Alexa device that we use in the kitchen/breakfast area.The device does have better sound playback overall. We use it primary for music.  But the device has several issues that make it worse than our ""old"" Alexa: (1) there seems to be a problem with the microphone. It does not capture the voice commands as good as the old device.  Sometimes we have to raise our voice so loud that the ""old"" alexa responds (and she is at the loft at the second floor!).  Most of the times, the commands do not come as intended.  I can hear from the playback of the commands in the history page that they are not as crisp as the ones recorded in the old device. (2) the smarthome integration embedded in the new alexa fights with our current smarthings hub all the time.  When scanning the sensors we see duplicates for most of them: one from the smarthing hub and another one from the alexa device.  Deleting the ones from alexa builtin smarthome hub fixes the issue.  The new alexa does have a better sound, but we resorted on swaping it for our ""old"" alexa instead and move the new alexa to the second floor, where it is rarely used.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Last year, we finally decided it had gotten old enough and traded it in for a new one. That was a mistake.The new Echo's want to be so helpful. Want some music? They'll gladly tell you all about Amazon's Music Unlimited subscription service, that just so happens is NOT included with Prime. Want to listen to the news? It'll turn on TuneIn, which'll make you listen to up to 10 minutes of commercials before actually playing the news. Want to track your Amazon purchases? It'll happily give you notifications, sometimes even without you asking or wanting them, about where your packages are.When the Echo starts blinking yellow, you're supposed to ask it what the notification is. Most of the time, it'll tell you about a Subscribe & Save item that's being delayed, or a package got delivered, etc. But sometimes, it'll recommend a book that you have absolutely no interest in.The book recommendations were my last straw. A little backstory first. As far as I can tell, out of roughly 1500 purchases I've made on Amazon in the last decade, perhaps 5 of them have been books, and none of them for me. They've all been cookbooks, or kids books, as gifts for others. So why, in the name of all that's holy, does the Echo insist on giving me notifications for random books that will be coming out? I don't want them. I don't care what they are. I have never, in the 8 years of owning an Echo, purchased a book through it. I've never asked it to read a book to me. I've never used it to play an audiobook. There is no overlap between what I've told it to do or what I've used it for, and upcoming book releases. That venn diagram is 2 circles with a mile between them. Yet, you CAN NOT disable these notifications. No amount of settings changes, or account updates, or even calling Amazon Tech Support, will remove them.I do not want book notifications. For that reason, I just bought a Homepod Mini, and I'll be returning my Echo. Maybe if Amazon updates their pushy marketing tactics, I'll get another one, but it's not likely.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

Now she works when she feels like it. Sometimes I'm 5 feet away and slowly raising my voice I get now responses to only a few moment later the TV says her name, and she starts having a conversation.  Other times she speaks quick gibberish to which my partner and I question our sanity, but mostly she throws out random facts then apologizes she's still learning. Which brings me to the next part.  She randomly dings, and blue ring glows for a few moments then done.  Totally random  and mostly at very quiet times.  Otherwise it's handy in a facts argument.I wish I could say this echo is great, or this thing sucks, but since I can\u2019t fully use it because the Alexa App is the most discouraging, frustrating, EVIL, POS ever created!

Went to investigate the noise. Again the loud crackle and then the music returned. Waited a bit and again. It was happening regularly , about 3 to 4 times a minute.  Unplugged and replugged to see if a reboot would help.  Sitting idle nothing. Asked Alexa to play music and it began playing - and again every 15-20 seconds the loud crackle if 1-2 second length.  Definite hardware failure.By the nature of it I suspect the circuits that feed the digital audio from that source in the cpu over to the digital to analog converter before it goes to the amp , is getting  the data corrupted and so what gets decode isn\u2019t the music signal not now a random jumble of loud digital noise. Packet corruption if you will.So fails on less than a week - a computer or build flaw. Back it goes. Given others habe reported this of may be a bigger batch or systemic failure of some bad components or issue with the board design that fails after some days of use.So if you are buying one in 2022 be sure to plug it in and make use of it playing music daily for at least a few weeks so you can get a refund / exchange more easily.

If your voice does not sound very close to how you said her name when you trained her to hear you she does not respond. Re training your voice may help just keep in mind that when you do the training try to pronounce her name at different pitches and volumes so she recognizes you more. It helped me out some but not perfectly.  I think the microphones are under her felt covering making it a little harder for her to hear the correct pronunciation of her own name. That's my best guess.Ok I love Alexa devices. I have 6 various devices in my home.  But this newer echo does not impress me. First of all the voice recognition for me is terrible. I don't know where they hid the microphones but it rarely hears me and it sits about 3ft from me. The earlier version does a better job so much so that i put the last edition near me and the new one out in living room. The new one seems to hear better when farther away from you.As for the sound i like the 360 sound much better that the new directional front facing sound in the new echo. The new echo does have better mid range but the 360 just sounds better it the place i put it.\n,,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Sometimes it randomly shuts off but my phone app shows it\u2019s connected and there\u2019s nothing in the settings or routine to make it do that. The routines you can set only allow one \u201cskill\u201d per routine which is inconvenient.

It would also be nice if, not only would it turn on my tv by voice, but if it would also launch sling or paramount + or discovery + by voice too.  Accents, celebrity voices, better connectivity, more consistency, and the ability to search all of your streaming services for a specific movie or show you ask for, as well as record them if you\u2019d ask it to would make it worth the price. As it is, kind of a rip off. If you really want one, get the dot. The price is more inline with what you get.

I got way better sound over the Dot. It sounds so much better. I got a free ring light that uses this model as a hub and so far it has worked great together. Works fast when charging light settings.I also hit a few issues that seem like issues with this model. One issue that I have over the my Echo Dot is with Bluetooth. When connected it works great and never disconnects but the fight to get this echo to see my phone is a struggle. Saying ""Connect to my phone"" works rarely. On my Echo Dot its works more around 95% of the time. Once connected though there are no issues with sound or dropping. Second issue is that it seems harder to get it to respond to ""Alexa"". I end up saying it over and over getting louder each time till I feel like I'm yelling at it. Since its 2 feet away on my desk this seems a bit strange. Again the Echo Dot didn't have this issue.Edit: After using it more my Bluetooth issues are worse. I don't now if it's a hardware or software issue but I'm thinking of returning it now.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

However, I expected the sound quality to step up a notch, and I think it could actually have dropped a notch instead, but very little.  I also think the voice recognition doesn't seem to be as good as other models.  Not sure if they did something different with the microphone array or not, but I quite often find myself asking a question and having an Echo from the other room respond, so it seems the microphones are not as sensitive.  It's important to note that I am not dissatisfied by audio quality since I have them pairs with the Echo sub, but without the sub I think the previous model sounds better overall.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

It will play again with no problem for a few songs and then repeat. Not the sonic experience I was looking for. I have tried on at least 3 occasions contacting Amazon and finding a fix. They have been polite but have offered no solution besides restart everything, start from scratch and disconnect the the devices and the internet and reconnect in reverse order. Nothing has worked.

The biggest smart-home items I have that I wanted to connect are my robot vacuum and robot mopper, from Neato and iRobot respectively.The Alexa app has robot vacuums as a main device category, but connecting them is really difficult. For the Neato vacuum, you have to connect your Neato account to Amazon. Fair enough, except that it only works if you used the same email address for both accounts! You will have to change your Neato email address to whatever you use with Amazon. Sorry if you wanted privacy.Connecting the iRobot mopper just didn't work. You have to install the iRobot skill, then add the bot as a device, but it won't connect to my Braava Jet robot at all. There is really no way to get help with it either. Amazon can't offer support for the dozens of 3rd party devices they claim to support, and iRobot doesn't know how to get it to work either. That is a hint of a failing ecosystem.I don't have any smart lights or anything like that yet, so what's left in terms of functionality is low-level features like the flash briefing. But even this seems like it's been neglected by Amazon. Many of the news sources on offer have stopped updating, so you can add them but Alexa just says they are unavailable every time. It's really difficult to customize also. I noticed if you ask Alexa how to edit your flash briefing she gives you inaccurate directions that don't reflect the current version of the Alexa app. If you manage to figure it out, you realize you can't really add useful things to your flash briefing like air quality for your city. It seems the boundaries of the experience are quite narrow, and they are becoming more narrow as the ecosystem shrinks. This is supposed to be a flagship device for Amazon and a key part of their strategy, but the experience has atrophied badly.\n",3 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

And then they send your Charcoal or Twilight Blue device with a white power cord. Pretty unbelievable that they did not color match the cord, especially since it needs to remain plugged in 100% of the time. Really disappointed. Returning three of these tomorrow. Google Home, here I come.FOLLOW UP - So I got a quick call and email from Amazon. But their response was even more disappointing. Here's the email:Hello, My name is Christian and I\u2019m from Amazon\u2019s Technical Support team. I'm sorry to hear about the issue/s experienced with your 4th Gen Echo, which prompted you to leave a critical review on Amazon.com. I tried to reach you over the phone, but unfortunately we didn't connect.  I understand you're rather concerned about the aesthetics of the white power cord. This was an intentional decision that we made so that the power cord could more easily blend in with white background (think drywall, etc.). Since we'd still like to offer you some options, you're free to purchase a replacement power adapter in black at the link below (your model takes 30 watts): https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079S8K1RPWhat a load of crap - This ""think drywall"" rationale makes sense if you have drywall that is painted white, which I can tell you, no one in the northeastern United States has. Amazon made the decision to throw a white cord in every box to save money on the non-white devices and/or get people to shell out another $20 for the color cord that should have been in the box. Really disappointing from Amazon and really shortsighted.2ND UPDATE - So, Amazon dropped the price on these by $30.00. I bought three of them, so I decide to stick with the Alexas despite the cord issue on the black. I call to get a price adjustment. Nope, you have to return all three and buy three new ones. Clearly Amazon is hoping this will be an impediment to customers trying to get the lower price. I say, that makes no sense because Amazon is going to have to eat additional shipping plus reboxing. Sales rep tells me, they have to do it that way because there are only so many at the sales price. Another customer service line of crap. So, in theory, they are going to take my $100 Alexas, put them on the side and sell them only after the sale. Doubtful.Overall, good product for the money.

Used them for years.  Our primary echo is in the kitchen which can be heard in the dining and living rooms.  Reading that the sound quality was so good, we decided to try this.  Well first, we didn't really like the looks.  Hard plastic rounded up the back and just not that good looking.  I know that is a personal choice.Now, if you are buying this for great louder sound, for anyone that has used echo's before, you know a echo remote is great for speaking to it and controlling the volume.The echo remote does not function on this and 4th gen devices which means we have to yell at the echo to try and do anything.  This is not only annoying and most of the time doesn't hear us but the loud requests are heard all over the house which lights up all the other echo devices.If you are close and want to control it manually, it sounds great but a little expensive.We sent it back and going for a 3rd gen echo but currently having problems with the echo remote on these devices.  If we want to use the remote we may have to  go back to our 2nd gen echo.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

The sound is even better if you adjust the equalizer to your liking.However actually controlling the device can be tricky, as the microphones aren't the best quality. I have an Echo Flex which has better microphones than this, however that might be because the Flex is hooked up to external speakers. But then again, it might not be.

For example: ""Alexa, what is the tallest building"" and she would tell me ""Burj Khalifa"", I'd ask ""And what is its height"" and she wouldn't know what is ""it"", she doesn't know we just spoke about the Burj Khalifa.The thing is that its been so many years already and it seems like there is no progress in her abilities and sometimes it's seems like she gotten worse through the years.I used to be able to play ""My sleep playlist from spotify"" but now she will always look for playlists made by Spotify instead of playing the playlists I created. Even if I'll name the playlist ""sleep by me"" or some other more specific name of a playlist that isn't public on Spotify, she'll say ""Sorry , I don't know a playlist called ""Sleep by me"" even though that is exactly the name, and she's connected to my Spotify user.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I have had no problems with voice recognition as others say they have had. This is perfect for what I wanted it for.

I was an early adopter and had it when Amazon only sold it through invitation only.  I was fine upgrading it because it definitely was well used during its life.  I've set the new one up and my negative review is based on playing music (regardless on what model you have).  Since I had echoes back in 2015/2016, you could always have the device play your music from you amazon library of music you purchased through amazon.  For instance, I would say ""Play songs by [particular artist]"".  Or ""Shuffle songs by [artist name]"".  That seems to be rather different in the last couple of months as Amazon upgraded their music services.  Now when I ask Alexa to shuffle or play songs from my library by a particular artist, she will no longer do that, but only play songs through Amazon music service where you are forced to listen to similar artists through their own library.  This is very frustrating and a terrible change.  It seems like they're always trying to get you to subscribe to pay for their premium music service.  All I want to do is play the songs I've purchased through amazon.  I really hope they correct this terrible change.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

This is an Alexa device, but it seems to have trouble recognizing when you are talking to it. I've found I have to pause after saying Alexa before I add the instruction. Even then, it often takes 4 or 5 tries to get the blue ring to light up. This behavior is consistent with both of these Echos, and with the larger version (I bought the three pack).I don't know what Amazon is doing under the covers, but I will say I've noticed a general degrading in voice recognition on other Echos, especially on the Echo Show. My guess is they have been dorking with the OS and have added too many ""features"" so that the CPU is overwhelmed and not as responsive as it once was.For example, I am now queried on a regular basis to give a rating to products I bought, and reminded that consumables I've purchased in the past might be running out.

I really do. But the problem is, I can't even use it to listen to music at all. The problem traces back to very poor voice recognition.While you're playing music through the device, you may want to ask Alexa to control your home. But it can't hear you use the wake word at all. So I chose to have it connect to my old Creative Bluetooth speaker, which I have been using with Alexa since my old 2nd gen Echo dot from years ago. Sad really.But even with that Bluetooth speaker, the recognition of the wake word is so unstable. Sometimes I'm having a conversation on the phone or have the TV on (quite a bit of yards away at the opposite side of the room actually), it thinks it heard ""Alexa"", when really no one and nothing said it. I have no idea.Meanwhile, when I actually want to trigger it and I'm actually saying ""Alexa"", it's a hit or miss; either it won't react and I'll have to say it two or three more times, or it will actually work. It works about half the time. When it doesn't work, sometimes I have to scream ""Alexa"" louder and louder just to trigger the wake word. Sometimes it has to be so loud that my throat gets sore just from screaming the wake word.And in my experience, these frustrations I'm having are unique to this Echo 4th generation. I've also owned and used the Echo Dot 2nd Generation (which sounds awful on its own but see my comment about Bluetooth speaker above), and the Echo Dot 3rd Generation. Personally, I wish I just stuck with the Echo Dot 3rd Generation. At least that one only got mistriggered (is that a word? Lol) whenever there was an Alexa ad on the TV.Overall, if you already own an Alexa device, I highly recommend you stay away from this because it'll feel like a downgrade.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

The sound quality is a remarkable improvement over the third generation ""dots."" However, after the first week of continuous use (I keep Alexa busy!), here are some things I noticed, all of which don't spoil my experience with this device.--The microphone to alert Alexa is near the base. So trying to make a request from above the device will not get a reply. This dot is placed by my bedside, but I've elevated it on two books, to make the microphone easily usable.--For those of us who are unable to use a hand-held device, we can't change the settings with any available app for computers--there apparently aren''t any--so we'll use this dot in ""default"" settings. So when I try to bring some music to a dot in one room (I have three third-generation dots besides this ""advanced"" dot), I get an offer by Alexa to switch the music from one device in another room, to the device I'm making the request from, but it never works--either Alexa turns the music off in the other room, or she's unable to turn it off, but nonetheless, I get no music from the dot I'm closest to!

Best one yet in terms of sound quality. Unfortunately it is really bad at picking up our voice compared to the other Echo devices. You either have to yell really loud or get very close. Not so bad when its not playing anything or the room is really quite. But still worse than the other earlier devices. This get much worse of course the louder you have it playing music and that is where it's really different than previous generations. So there is a price to pay for having great sound, which is poor voice recognition. And yes it was setup to recognize our voices.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

Like: The new model sounds better than both of my previous Echoes.  I sat them side by side and played a song with plenty of bass at the same volume level.  The new model was louder and produced deeper bass.  I prefer the sphere over the cylinder and the fabric cover over none at all.  The internal temperature sensor is a nice addition as is the Zigbee hub.Dislike: This latest version has A LOT of trouble hearing me even when I'm in the same room it's in and the room is quiet.  In fact, sometimes my third generation Echo Dot hears me despite it being in the adjacent room.  I frequently have to repeat myself or raise my voice before the new model hears me.  This was never the case with the devices I traded in.  I read somewhere the latest Echo has just 4 microphones instead of 7.  What a shame.

Alexa on Echo uses Amazon's proprietary search engine. Google is the gold standard for search engines, in my humble opinion. Amazon's engine meets the level of aluminum; the most abundant metal on earth. The Echo device is very capable as far as the hardware is concerned. However, the software, and the search engine in particular, is junk. After 6 months, I quit. I must admit that I now own a very expensive voice activated switch system that understands me 50% of the time.19FEB2022: I am happier with Ziggy. His voice is more pleasing to my ears. I call him ""Computer"". I miss him when I'm away from home but have yet to find an affordable option so he can travel along with me. My smartphone won't keep Alexa running without quickly sucking the battery dry; even connected to power in the car. However, I am finding that the Alexa software is getting smarter and there are more skills and blueprints available now. I am hopeful that this trend will continue.

I can say the sound is a big step up from the last generation Echo, but the microphones are a tremendous disappointment. Compared to the prior generation, it doesn't register my voice commands nearly as much and, when it does, it seems to have a higher error rate. I've tried to compensate by moving the device around or just rotating it at different angles, and the problems still exist. I'm seeing some similar comments in the reviews, so I have to conclude that Amazon just ""dropped the ball"" on this one (hilarious, I know.).Would not recommend. Instead spring for an Echo Studio (if you have the spot for a larger speaker) or an Echo Show 8 (if you don't mind the screen), as that model also has really nice sound but does not have the same microphone problems as this model. Or just wait until generation 5.EDIT: Amazon customer service (best in business, no doubt) called and tried to troubleshoot the device a bit. Doing a factory reset seemed to help slightly, but there is just no way this device hears me as well as previous generations or the other Echo iterations that I own.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

Or multiple soni (sp?) I already have sonos and the set up is a breeze.  It's like uncorking a bottle and watching spellbound as Barbara Eden floats out.

It was fine for a while and they would disconnect occasionally but now they won't connect at all. I spent 2 hours trying to fix the issue myself before contacting support then nearly 2 more hours with support and still no resolution. They said they would contact me in 5-7 business days so who knows...My other issues with the devices are that they never seem to understand anything I say. I had the old echo dots and had very few issues with them understanding me. One would assume the newer more expensive devices would work better, right? with these I commonly get the response ""I'm sorry, I didn't get that"" or ""something went wrong."" My favorite was when I asked to turn the lights down and Alexa played me the song Mr Grinch. When I ask to adjust the thermostat she will either play some random song or tell me that I'm 2.2 miles from the city I live in. Other voice commands give equally random results.Also, one of my devices started reporting the room temperature in \xb0C instead of \xb0F out of the blue one day. If I asked for the outside temp or the other rooms temp, it would respond in \xb0F, but the room I was in was \xb0C. I spent 2 hours with support resetting the device, adjusting settings and restarting the router before giving up and swapping that device for one in another room.If you want a device that doesn't do what it's advertised to do and does do random stuff when you ask for something, then this is the device for you.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

The temperature control functionality is unuseful. It seems to require the temperature to cross the setpoint before triggering an action. For example, if the temperature setpoint is 75 degrees and its 76 degrees, the action will not trigger. It only triggers when the temperature drops below 75 degrees and then increases back to 76 degrees. This is useless logic for temperature controllers, but apparently a legacy problem. I rated two stars because this amounts to false advertising. Otherwise I have been using Echos for years and I am satisfied with most capabilities.I also tried integrating a Hubitat controller with Alexa to send a virtual switch. Unfortunately Alexa routine triggers are limited to schedule and temperature sensor. Alexa will not allow the virtual switch as a trigger.12/20/20 Update:Amazon tech support called me after reading this review. They suggested including all devices in the routine which didn't fix the issue. We also tried deleting and adding back the routine. We tried a schedule trigger instead of a temperature trigger which did work. Basically temperature routines don't work. Today I successfully paired an external zigbee temperature sensor.

The positives are:  better sound quality for music and a faster response time for many of the commands.  Negatives are:  this Echo does not 'hear' nearly as well.  Often, even when close by it won't hear us say 'Alexa...' and if we are more than 10 feet away, we have to shout to get it to hear.  So if you have one of these primarily to play music and it's always close by, then it's probably worth upgrading.  But using it for other functions or if it's not so close, probably not.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I've had this unit for more than 6 months, but just now getting tired of it's deficiencies and decided to write a review. First off, the smart hub features seem to work fine. My issues are with voice recognition and audio quality. It's pretty crappy.I have a same generation Echo Dot across the room. Often if I'm standing immediately next to this larger Echo hub and say something to it, it doesn't respond, but the one 20 feet away across the room does. Sometimes I can make 2 back-to-back requests, standing next to the unit with my mouth facing it, and with the same voice volume - one of the requests will be answered by it and the other will be answered from the unit 20 feet away.I do not believe it is simply ""confusion"" between the two units.  Before I had the Dot, I would have experienced the hub unit simply not responding to my voice at all.Audio quality is terrible - I have a house full of Echo's including a 1st generation Echo.  It is very muffled, like if you turned up bass to the max, and treble to the min. It's almost as if it simply doesn't produce ANY high frequencies.  My same generation Echo dot, and 1st generation Echo sound FAR better. My Dot w/clock sounds fine.  but this unit, just like the prior edition hub sound like they are under a pillow.  and yes, I have adjusted bass down and treble up...tiny bit of improvement but it still sucks.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

We were impressed with the sound quality of the echo, the depth of sound is pretty good.However!  The quality of the sound is moot when you can\u2019t get the device to actually play music.  This is the most glitchy device I have ever purchased.  We\u2019ve had issues from the beginning.  I would have to reconnect it to the wifi almost daily, sometimes restarting my router just to get the stupid thing to reconnect, even though every other device in the home was connected.Ok, maybe there was something wrong with the signal of our router, so we purchased google routers and placed them all over our house to broadcast the signal better.  I guess that worked because we haven\u2019t had Alexa tell us she\u2019s not connected to the internet anymore.  But NOW she just won\u2019t play music whenever she doesn\u2019t feel like doing it.  In order to get the echo play music nowadays we have to unplug it for a minute and then plug it back in and that will last for a while. If we have music playing in the background for a couple of hours, you can tell when it needs to be unplugged and plugged back in because it will just decide to stop playing music for no reason.Would have returned it right away and given it one star if the sound quality was garbage.  But my husband is willing to put up with it because while it\u2019s working, after all the screwballing around to get it to work, it sounds great.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

At the very least, give customers a cord color option; for me, my intended placement was a black granite counter btwn my kitchen and family rm, so no opportunity to conceal. Why should I have to pay $20-30 extra for a color-matched cord? Never has been an issue for past Echo devices, of which I have MANY... 14 I thinkSecond: I've grown fond of the cylinder shape, not a fan of this spherical shape; it might make sense if the sound was not front-firing, but sadly is. I could grow accustomed to that if not for the white cord, which Hubby said he could paint, but why should that even need to be a consideration?

Firstly, though the sound is mediocre for its price point, it does not sound as great as the early 2019 one I heard.  This one sounds ok in a large bedroom, but fails miserably in a smaller bedroom (my craft room). There, it, literally, sounds like what it is...a small basic Bluetooth speaker.  Very treble!  I turned it off an connected my iPad back up to the Bluetooth stereo system instead.  I am going to keep it as it does integrate SiriusXM amongst others, but it will remain in the larger bedroom.  Setup was not terribly fun.  My daughter has a dot (those sound worse than this one) and anytime I told Alexa to do something, it went on HER echo...even though we were on opposite ends of the house.  I think this is made more to be used as a system throughout the house versus a more individual toy. I think I got it sorted out now, but there are still issues. It doesn't always respond and it does go out.  I've read it's a WiFi issue, but nothing else goes out when the echo goes out.  My daughter loves hers (she's 16), but she's addicted to music subscription services.  Would I buy it if I had to again?  Probably not.  I'm not too much into this smarthome  technology.  I'm more into sound quality...if the competitor's had Bluetooth, it'd be sitting here instead of the Echo.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

However, I often, although asking for a certain book to continue, get the last book I listened to starting up. Then when I ask for the sleep timer to be set to 15 mins, something it does it perfect. Other times it sets a timer for 15 mins and audible shutdowns within 30 seconds. Even thought I use the same command each time ""Alexa set sleep timer for 15 mins"".

I'm also super frustrated that podcast can't be fast-forwarded to specific time within the podcast. I use this feature all the time when Alexa plays an audible book, so why can't it be used for podcast as well? I also feel like this most recent iteration of the echo doesn't understand what I'm asking, even though I can  use a similar phrase for my studio Echo and I'll be understood. I tried to buy an adapter to put it on the wall cuz I hate how much space it takes on surfaces, and of course I ended up with a dot wall adapter for the echo instead of this size. I just wish they would call it a different name or a different induration or something to make it identifiable without me having to feel like an expert at the dimensions of each of the objects. I found it really irritating that the cord for the power had been shortened almost a foot, and I couldn't put this new echo in the same location as my old Echo because they switch the power integration port to an AUX port instead of whatever it was before.

In two key ways, they have not.1. Mics are less effective.The mics are actually worse at picking up my voice. I find myself repeating the wake word more often, and at a louder volume, just to get the same result. The old cylinder was pretty omni-directional; they new one less so.2. The sound is overly bassy.Yes, you can adjust the bass through the app to tone it down, but you shouldn't have to. I don't have the old and new side by side, so it's hard to judge which sounds better overall, but at least on the default bass setting the new one seems less accurate.What do I like better on the new one? It's shorter, so it doesn't stick out as much on the kitchen island where it lives. You can judge for yourself whether the new esthetic is better, but the design change was not the reason I purchased the new one - I thought the mics and sound would be better, and I'm disappointed.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Another thing I have noticed, is that when bluetooth paired with a fire stick; apps like hulu and Netflix seem to crash.This was bought for me as a gift and the pictures are somewhat misleading as they do not show a cord in many of them. This lead to the belief that it had an internal battery that allowed it to be moved between rooms. (Which would have been a great selling point). This device does not have an internal battery. In fact the charge cable it comes with is short, so keep that in mind when thinking about where you wish to place it. I have a first gen alexa and the cable that came with it is longer.A note for Amazon, when this device was first advertised, it showd a globe pattern. When I saw that, I wanted this device.

The 3rd Gens are great, they hear you every time. they stay connected to the internet, they do what they're made to do every singe time.--The 4th Gens do the exact opposite, from day one all of the 4th Gen ones I have purchased have done nothing but fail to do what they are made to do. They have better speakers, and this big one has added a temperature sensor, which is truly a game changer for routines, allowing Alexa to monitor the temperature of a room and adjust accordingly on her own. Howver she NEVER hears me say her name the first time, 80% of the time once she does, she will not hear the command I give her. How is an Echo supposed to work if it cannot understand its user. That is literally the ONLY thing these things need to do--well that and stay connected to the internet. there is a 50/50 shot that when I say her name, she gives me the ""the intertnet isnt accessible"" line. When it Very much is. every other device I have connects and stays connected just fine. It is only the 4th Gen echos that have so much trouble staying connected.  The temperature sensor is the only real thing worth even trying to buy one of these, but its hugely unreliable at best, and sadly no other temperature sensor can initiate a routine based on the rooms degree yet. -----Do not waste your money on the 4th gen, buy a 3rd gen or wait for the 5thand Amazon, do NOT call me this time. The last time I left a negative review on an echo device (the 4th gen dot) you called me. --I appreciate the gesture, amazing customer support, one of the reasons I love amazon. but this is not a user error, I do IT for a living, this is not failure to set up properly, this is device malfunction.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Part of this is the removal of the volume adjustment via the top ring.One more note, the control buttons are right on the fabric, so grimy hands will stain the speaker mesh over time.

It\u2019s a great idea to include the Zigby hub. However even Amazon is confused on what devices are supported to directly work with this device. I could not find sensors that reliably work with this echo fourth generation. Awara sensors don\u2019t work, Amazons on ring sensors don\u2019t work. It is a great product with an odd shape but Amazon still does not have the complete story on this yet. Best sensors use Seaver, but Amazon abandoned zwave in this echo.

If you're thinking about it, DON'T DO IT!1) The 4th gen devices don't seem to pick up voice commands as well.  We frequently use the Echo in our family room on the 1st floor.  Even though we are 5 feet away and within line of sight of the Echo, our Echo show upstairs in a room with a *closed* door hears the command instead and prevents the family room Echo from responding.  The activity logs indicate the Echo Show wasn't the intended device, but ultimately none of them respond so we have to repeat the command.2) The sound is awful.  The previous Echo's had a nice range and good base.  The 4th gen echo sounds very hollow and tinny.  If you like to listen to music through your Echo, avoid the 4th gen devices!!3) The light ring is now on the bottom of the Echo, so unless the device is placed at a position lower than you, you probably won't be able to see it.  Considering the mic can't pick up your commands well, you'll often wonder if it's doing anything at all since you get no indications.While not a 4th gen specific issue, the Echo is going to constantly be trying to upsell you on Amazon services.  If you request a song that isn't on Prime, it's going to try and upsell you their Ultimate Music service, then it's going to start playing some ""station"" that is not the song you request.  100% of the time I have to further request that it stop playing the station, which it can't hear me well so I end up yelling for it to stop 4 or 5 times.  Overall, the Echo has gone from a fun device that was worth the potential privacy concerns to an annoying banner ad that you can't click to close.  The current user experience makes me just want to throw these things in the trash and I own 4 of them.\n",3 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I still have and use my Gen 1 every day. I currently have 9 of them including Echo Autos, 4 dots, and an Echo Flex. I purchased this 4th gen to replace the 1st gen that I use as the main Echo in my living room. The 1st gen is still working great, but it's not compatible with some of the new Alexa features.We got it last year on black Friday. It would respond to commands OK for a few hours. After that, it would stop responding entirely. You could manually wake it with the button, but it would not hear you at all. A power reset would fix it, for a few hours or a day and then it would happen all over again. After dealing with Amazon, they sent a replacement. The replacement had the same issue. Even when it did work, you had to speak very loud and close. The Echo dots on the other side of the house would respond instead of this one 3 feet away.The Echo was placed in the same location as the one it replaced, on the same network.After going through 2 units, we figured there was some sort of known issue. We returned the second unit and went back to our 1st gen. A year later (hoping that the issues have been worked out), we purchased another unit. Guess what? New unit has the same exact issue.Search Google for Echo 4th gen microphone issues and you will see this happens to a lot of people. Even when they do worth, they don't work nearly as good as previous generations. Which is a shame.For now, this one is going back again and we will continue to use our 1st gen until Amazon can get it together.\n",2 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

If I listen to the same 3 podcasts weekly, and I ask to hear the latest episode of one of those podcasts, how can Alexa constantly misunderstand and play some obscure podcast I've never heard before? Other times, I ask the Echo to do something basic like telling me the time, the blue light comes on for a second, but Alexa never says or does anything, not even ""Sorry, I didn't understand you."" The old Echos never did that.The real kicker, though, is the execrable ""by the way"" feature, which constantly asks me if I want to use some ability that I'm not interested in. I find myself actually getting mad and swearing at Alexa when she asks me if I want to try some inane, useless skill. If anyone at Amazon is actually listening to what I say to my Echo, then I apologize for my salty language. But if you continue to annoy me rather than assist me, then I'm going to move from swearing at my new Echos to throwing them in the trash and switching to Google's platform.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

What happened?I am so disappointed. I worked with Amazon tech-support, and even they said there must be something wrong, so they processed a return and shipped me a new set and they are equally horrible. I have read independent reviews on third-party websites, and watched them on YouTube, where reviewerss are saying Generation 4 is a total fail. I sure hope the fifth generation will go back to the sound quality of previous generations.I have had many speakers from every generation going back to the first generation (which ironically, was one of the best sounding speakers they made).Also, when you pair these fourth generation Echo speakers with a Fire TV or Fire TV stick, they are somewhat acceptable on the trailers and previews, since the volume of those, same with commercials, is so artificially boosted, (though the speakers are still disappointingly soft and poor quality), but the minute you start the actual show or movie, the sound instantly becomes so quiet that I would equate it to about a volume level 4 on previous generations.I think these were rushed to market because the engineers thought the new round shape was so cool.

Whyyyyyyy?When I ask Alexa to play music while I'm in the living room, she will respond from the proper device ""what would you like to listen to?"", but then she will start playing the music on the Echo Dot in my bedroom. When I tell her she is playing on the wrong device she'll respond ""I'm sorry, I don't recognize a device by that name"". When I ask her to stop playing the music it she won't, because she's does not recognize I'm talking about the bedroom unit. When I ask her to stop playing music in the Bedroom, she doesn't understand. When I ask her to play music, again, she says ""Amazon Music is currently streaming on another device"". Ugh.

After 6 months it needs replugging.,"\nBefore this device I used a Google Nest.  The voice recognition on the Amazon Echo does not compare to Google Nest.  The Amazon Echo, gets confused about 40% of the times, this never happened with the Google Nest.  After 6 months of use, Alexa goes silent (no light) and the only way to fix this is to unplug and re-plug the device.  I have been patiently doing this, hoping the issue was going to get fixed on its own but for the last two month the issue is occurring more and more often and I now need to unplug/re-plug the device about every 2-3 days.  Another issue with the device is I usually have it at a low volume to listen to my tv (line in) and during the day I raise the volume but at the same time, Alexa\u2019s volume is raised so when I say a command, Alexa is extremely loud.  I wish Alexa\u2019s volume was separate to avoid this. Now let\u2019s talk about warranty coverage...  It's unbelievably painful to find and get to warranty support for this device.  Once I found the link to chat, I was on a chat troubleshooting for about 2 hours.  At the end, when the agent decided to process the warranty, she wanted me to ship the item first to Amazon, wait a few days for them to process it and then send me the replacement.  The agent then told me she couldn't process it and asked me to delete my home address and re-enter (to check, if that was going to allow her to process the request).  I requested to have a supervisor call me and as I'm writing this, I'm still waiting for the supervisor to take some type of action.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I didn't really care for the 4th generation sphere design but I had hoped that the technology will make up for it.

Never had such an issue with 1st generation Echo, now I think why did I replace it in the first place. It even used to prompt if I got the response from the right device.The most disappointing is the Amazon support not helpful at all. When I reached out to the Chat support they gave me the excuse device software was out of date, I asked why it didn't update automatically, they told me device needs to be idle for half hour. Forget during the day when everyone is awake, it didn't find an idle time at night as well when everyone was asleep \U0001f923\U0001f602I was able to reproduce the issue today, I asked the Echo 3 questions but every time the Echo Dot in the different room responded and when I called Amazon support, they asked me to reproduce the issue even though they could see in my voice history which device responded to the questions.I tried to reproduce the issue when I was on call, it didn't happen, they said we will call in an hour. I never heard back from Amazon support and instead got an email saying they couldn't reach me. Very disappointed!!Verdict: I won't suggest to upgrade...poor device and very horrible customer service. 1st generation Echo was definitely louder and I preferred the overall design.

I tried to decrease Echo voice volume by pressing the volume button on the device, by using voice command, by using Alexa app on my cell phone. But nothing worked. Every time I decrease volume, it comes back to default in few hours, or in best case, in one day. So, next morning it is too loud again. It also, occasionally, stops playing music by itself in the middle of playing or just ignore my command to play after repeating my command. One time, out of sudden, it started playing music by itself. And I have exactly the same problem with Echo Dot.I had to change my rating from 3 to 2 stars.This is update.Echo Dot is a good device. It produces a decent sound and recognizes my commands without any problem. And it is convenient and funny. One of the reasons I purchased the Echo was to play songs without using my computer or CD or mp3 player or phone. However, when I  asked Alexa to play a particular song, for example Girl by the Beatles, Alexa replied that I have to sign up for a $3.99 per month account and played some other random song. If you already has some a paid music account then Echo will be a good choice for you. But this is not that I wanted. Will probably return it.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

I was fortunate enough to be one of the early owners. It\u2019s been pretty good. I mean\u2026she gets a little mixed up sometimes. Our whole home is integrated with Alexa. Lights, thermostats, plugs, garage door, door locks\u2026you name it. Mostly, we really like it. We use it every day. I love the shopping list most of all but I also like walking into a room and turning on lights or the tv with my voice. I really enjoy changing the temperature without picking up my phone. Love it. I hear Amazon is losing a ton of money on these things so I guess I can see why the quality is going down.We finally upgraded to this new orb because our really old tube style Alexa was getting very hard of hearing. I hate this new one. It\u2019s garbage. I\u2019ll ask a question and she loudly yells at me. The volume is currently set to 3. I\u2019ll ask her the temperature moments later and I can\u2019t hear her but barely. I cannot find a fix for this. I\u2019m just over it.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Don\u2019t waste your money,\nI love Alexa and own multiple Good evening.  ration of them starting from beta version. I highly recommend Alexa to everyone. However I am giving this 4the generation unit 3 stars as there is no significant difference between this and older version.  This newer unit works fine. I bought this newer 4th generation version thinking it must be better than the older version. I was disappointed as I don\u2019t see a much of a difference at all. Sound quality is pretty much same as previous version.  Buttons and volume control ring is better in previous version. The older unit\u2019s volume ring allows you to lower volume quickly with one smooth motion. In newer units you need to press small volume button multiple times to lower volume. This isn\u2019t a show stopper as you can just voice control Alexa to lower volume. All this highlights is that controls were better thought thru in older unit.Bottom line I highly recommend Alexa to any 1st time user.

For whatever reason, the microphone really struggled with me. Commands like ""Alexa, lights at 20% brightness"" or even ""Alexa, lights on"" often failed to register. And when they did, there were often multi second delays. I recently switched to the echo studio for the sound quality, and was surprised with its responsiveness in contrast to the gen 4. It barely drops commands and processes stuff swiftly, despite lacking the newer processor and other tech in the gen 4.As for the sound, well that part's subjective. I wasn't very into how bassy the tuning was, and how much audio processing there seemed to be. YMMV.I'm glad I didn't give up with the echo after my bad experience with the gen 4. Even my brief experience with the echo studio has painted clearly that Alexa is a capable and fast assistant-gen 4 just seems to be a poor hardware to support it.

First and foremost, I love my multiple Echo and Echo dot units (I have six in total); one red and white with the others all being charcoal (black). All are 3rd Gen. the red and white one came with a white cord/adapter to match. ALL of the others in charcoal came with black cord/adapter. I went ahead and ordered the 4th Gen echo sphere in charcoal, and was irritated to see that they had put a white cord/adapter in the box. I contacted Amazon, and they told me the charcoal units should ship with black cord/adapter, not white, which doesn't match at all, and stands out as looking ""mismatched"" with the unit. Amazon sent me another unit which arrived yesterday a charcoal Echo with a WHITE CORD AND ADAPTER. It simply doesn't look right and I can't ""hide"" it. I took a chance on orderingthe new spherical design, and may end up returning both units and sticking with the 3rd Gen units I have. I don't understand why Amazon wouldn't continue matching the units with a cord color that corresponds with the color of the Echo unit. This is too big and they never should have messed with the vertical design. Hate the directional speakers and the bottom light. I may return all my ""balls"" and find the original designs.

It doesn't respond to verbal command to stop, a restart doesn't fix it, and no reminder can be cleared through the phone app, so I guess I have a round brick now.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

For instance when I ask her to respond she responds in very low volume but then when she goes back to music it's back to a normal volume.  When you change the software volume slider then it has the music blasting.The other problem for such a big globe which took place of the spherical Dot that I replaced it with;. It seems to have trouble understanding the Wake word unlike any of my other previous generation echo devices.And in general it clearly has a hearing problemLike some others have written I assume there's a software fix for these issues, but it's a nuisance to have a 4th generation product  have such issues right out of the box so to speak..\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

These work great. This new Echo is awful!We are now on our THIRD 4th generation Echo. The first one (Round One) hooked up beautifully to all our devices, but was totally hard of hearing. We would stand 2 feet away from Alexa and scream to get her to respond. This device is located on our main floor. The device in our bedroom a floor up and rooms away would respond before the one two feet away did. So Amazon send us a new one. This was after spending 45 minutes on the phone with customer service.Round Two 4th generation hears perfectly well but is completely was unable to connect with out two brand new Philips Hue light bulbs which were part of the package that came with Round One. Chatted first with someone in the US on fixing this. Seemed like we might be getting somewhere but she put me on hold. Next thing I knew I was talking with someone in India (I think) explaining the whole thing ALL OVER AGAIN. He put be through to someone in the Philippines. Starting from scratch AGAIN I was on the phone with her for 57 minutes!!! It was truly the definition of insanity. Doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result! She finally says something is wrong with your 4th generation ECHO and ships me another new one.Round Three 4th generation Echo arrives today. Same nightmare as Round Two. Spent 40 minutes on the phone with Amazon Customer services. He states that the only literature he has to go off of is really old!!! Echo is STILL NOT ABLE TO SEE new Philips Hue Lights! He tells me to contact Philips Hue.I've now been on the phone with Philips Hue for 60 minutes! Still not working.Amazon's customer service is NOT knowledgeable about this issue!\n",One person found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Sound is fairly decent but the connect between the device and the Amazon ""cloud"" is really buggy. Sometimes, it'll play all day. Other days it will stop after about 20 minutes. It doesn't seem to understand what I say sometimes as well. It will either not do anything or do something entirely different. And if you say anything to it, it refers you to the support section of the app.The idea is great but it's not done well. They need to rehire some folks and return to the cylinder shape.

I was disappointed a bit that this 4th gen device was not as good at recognizing its wake word ('Alexa'), as my older echo devices.  With the 4th generation device I have to be very careful to directly face the unit and enunciate when using the wake word.  My older units do not require this.(FWIW - I've altered the positioning of this 4th gen device a few times to ensure it wasn't some sort of audio bouncing that was the issue. The unit performs the same regardless of its location.)Also, unlike my older devices, this 4th generation Echo seems to often just not respond if it cannot answer or properly interpret a voice command/request.  I can see the wake word activates the unit but then it does not respond to commands it has trouble with. I have mixed feelings about this.  I don't miss the occasional 'I did not understand that request' (paraphrasing the response older Echo devices used.) but at the same time really dislike the device just going silent as though nothing had been said - and forcing me to wake it again.To be clear - the issues with this 4th generation device are truly minor.I remain a big fan of echo devices and Alexa in general.Solid build quality, excellent speech interpretation, amazing performance overall.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

The sensor in the echo will say it's 71 but all the other sensors will say 80 in this room.Update: changed this to a 1 star. I constantly have to repeat commands to my echo and then it will take about 60 seconds to complete them, if it ever does complete them.Love the sound quality but it takes longer than my 3rd gen echo dot did to execute commands.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

You really can't hold it comfortably in one hand. The sound is somewhat improved , the quality of the sound is often the quality of the location the sound is heard in.

Here's the problem: the marketing tells you that you can pair this echo with a fire tv ""to feel scenes come to life with home theater audio."" The reality is that audio can only come from EITHER your tv's speakers OR your echo. NOT BOTH. It isn't a home theater experience at all unless you want to buy multiple echo devices. And then it is only possible to pair the fire tv with a maximum of 2 echo devices and a sub. So even if you want to spend extra money, it's going to be a subpar ""home theater"" experience.  It took me an hour on customer service getting passed around before I was told that it was impossible to get sound from both the tv speakers and the echo at the same time (despite the fact that it will do this to play music, according to customer support it is not possible while watching tv).

A few days later, there was a price drop on the 4th gen Echo, so I bought one and compared them.First, I should've realized the price dropped for a reason... the reviews which state that the Echo mic is bad are so true.  I have to speak so loud (even when no other sounds in the room), I can be heard two rooms away.When Alexa does respond, there's a serious lag and the volume temporarily decreases (long enough that I thought I'd accidentally asked Alexa to lower the volume) only to realize this happens every time I ask Alexa anything.The Echo sound is relatively full.  However, I prefer the midrange of the Echo dot.I don't care for either device as a single speaker so I tried to pair the Echo and the Echo dot.What??  Each speaker pairs individually with FireTV, smart light bulbs, etc., but an Echo and Echo dot will only work together for music and, possibly, audio books.They CAN'T BE PAIRED together for stero listening with, e.g., FireTV.  I researched this to ensure I wasn't missing something and all web results verified this issue.  Please let me know if I'm wrong!Bottom line, I'll be returning the 4th gen Echo for sure.

I bought 2 echos, one for my living room and another for my bedroom, both sit at about 5-6 ft away from where I regularly speak to them from and when they are not reproducing anything I have a hard time getting them to hear me. Not to mention when the music is on, especially on high volume, you literally have to SCREAM to have a possibility of them hearing you. This is both with the dot and echo 4th gen, for comparison I have 3rd gen echo dots, echo show 5 and echo flex, needless to say they all hear me waaaaay easier, to give an idea of this: I have an echo flex out in my hallway outside of my bedroom and sometimes it hears me before the echo in the room, despite it being easily an additional 5ft away with walls in the way. It's very disappointing that they downgraded the microphones on these for whatever the reason, especially because one of it's main features to sell is you being able to communicate through voice, for this reason I have to give it a 2 star rating regardless of all it's pros.

I have purchase many echo dots since then (8-10). Our family loves them all. This fourth generation echo is subpar at best in my opinion.I have owned it for about a year now and the device does not respond as well as the dots. I wish I would have returned it when purchased because it does not function well as an Alexa Assistant.We are constantly having to repeat ourselves when sitting right beside the device. It often does not complete the requested task when it does hear us. It\u2019s ability to listen and respond is far inferior to all the other echo dots we have (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th generation).The sound quality is good but that is not a significant selling point for me personally. I wanted Alexa to work well on a device with sound better/louder than the dot. That isn\u2019t a high bar for sound quality since the dots are small.

I live on a small fixed income. I have an older affordable flip cell phone. I received the Alexia as a Christmas gift. I was so thrilled until I discovered I need a phone with the ability of applications to use the Alexia. I looked at the prices of smartphones and they are far out of my price range. WHY, did you make Alexia work on applications? And WHY didn't you just build the application into the Alexia? Now I can't use it at all until I can afford to buy a smartphone. So angry with you, I just sat and cried when I found this out. It's always all about making as much money as possible, isn't it? So glad there are fewer days ahead of me than behind me.

It's a shame, because otherwise this would be handy in my life.  As it is I find myself frustrated with it quite a bit.  It's like having a stranger chime up in my living room every once in a while about things they want to rip me off with.Great for timers, though that is very limited as well.I guess I would call the device 'smart lite'.  It reminds me of back when streaming was locked up by only a few companies and the interfaces really sucked.  At least that got a little better over the years, like skip options, etc. Alexa in it's current state feels crippled, crippled because Amazon can, not because it has to.As a device it's a single speaker so limited in it's application and basically a really expensive paper weight when the internet goes down or the amazon servers go down.\n",,Color: Twilight BlueConfiguration: Echo

As for their tips; they showed me my area of lack of knowledge and how to correct it. In the app you can adjust the Bass, Mid, and Treble I didn't know that. Having made this changes the sound is far better. For the mic they had me remove and resync the devices. This shad had a somewhat positive result but it is still to early to be 100% sure. I would say accuracy has gone up 50% but still not fully there. I hope this can be figured out further with software updates. I will update this again in a few months to see if it has changed.

I would have been better off getting a nice Bluetooth speaker and linking it to the generation 5 echo dot.  i will probably do this when I get to the point of donating this gen 4 to my work and watching the hilarious reaction when it it mangles questions, commands and music requests.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

As to being deaf, the Echo 4 requires that one must be very close (4-5 feet) or to yell in order for Alexa to receive commands. Also, there is no remote available for Echo 4.

They arrived, and after setup I have noted that the new Echos are slower to respond and be ready to accept commands than the original Dots.If you say ""Alexa"" the original dot is ready within about a second to be listening, but the new units are two to three seconds slower to even begin listening so now instead of saying ""Alexa what is the weather today"" you have to say,""Alexa........"" go have a coffee, twiddle thumbs,""..................what is the weather today."" They are also definitely slower than the google home units. This appears to have been a big step backwards in regards to speed.

This time I wanted to upgrade to see if the sound is really better. And it is! This speaker is great for playing music. The mic to wake up and voice recognition is also great.There is one major flaw why I returned the item. If you set a volume loud enough to hear Alexa well it will blow you away when you play music. If you turn it down so the music is not waking up the neighbors it is simply too low to hear Alexa. The echo dot is way better balanced.

I purchased 2 of the echo 4th gen speakers and in 2 different homes(on 2 different internet/wifi systems) they would regularly cut out at least every other song.  As such I bought 2 of the new echo dots, and have them bluetoothed to much better speakers and have save >$100.  Sadly, with the 2 brand new echo dots, I am still getting the cut out and at times static but only when I am playing the music over multiple dots.  The echo 4th gen speakers are being returned as the cost does not justify the music regularly cutting out.  I'm sure that at some point they will figure out how to run multiple echo speakers/dots without the music cutting out or high levels of static, but until then I am going to cut my losses.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

When the headband detects I've woken up in the middle of the night, it connects to BT and starts play sleep sounds to get me back to sleep. Unfortunately, every time the Echo connects to BT it announces very loudly ""Connected to iPhone!"" which startles me. I've done research and there have been complaints since 2016 of this but Amazon is not listening to their customers. There is no way to change it. Even if announcements are set to off and brief mode is on.Unfortunately, that meant I have to return and get a Google Nest Audio, which meant if I really want to use the Muse headband I have to switch my smart home to Google. All I can say is if you want some peace with the BT feature on a smart speaker, get the Google Nest Audio. It's much better. It will play a soft connection sound.

I call customer service at least every 3rd month.  When you ask when someone was born who is famous, be sure you have the name exact and pronounce it correctly.  Otherwise you get someone else.  When you ask about an actor to find out how old they are you don't always get the right person.  You must know exactly what their full name is to hopefully get the right person. Setting routines up most of the time you need customer service to walk you through.  What seem logical is not. I have decided to give it one more year and if they do not improve getting information from it, I will give it to Goodwill and let someone else have the heard ache.  NOT a real stable device to live with. If you are a very young person and like a lot of silly things then this is the device for you.

It also does not go as loud as my other Alexa. I do not notice any improvement in the sound quality. I also don't think Alexa responds as well as the taller one. The only advantage is the pause button, so I can put Alexa to sleep while my 3 yo grandson is visiting so he'll stop yelling at her to do things.

However, the light ring at the base of the orb is far too bright and too large. There is no way to disable this unnecessary light ring. I buy speakers to listen to them not to watch them. I rate this product a fail for the inability of users to disable the light ring.The light ring feature on the new Echo 4th gen is a complete failure. It is too large. It is too bright. When I mute the microphone it glows bright red for no good reason since the microphone button is also glowing red. The designers of the device failed. I should be able to turn  off the light ring completely. But I can't even adjust its brightness. I can't use this device where I wanted since it always calls too much visual attention to itself. I don't need a light ring. My Google Nest Audio Speaker, which costs about the same as the Echo 4th generation, does not call unwarranted attention to itself, like the Amazon device.The Echo worthless to me and I expect to return it and replace it with another Google Nest Audio Speaker.

I hired a professional to hook everything up and get the speaker system going, one of the speakers was defective and needed to be returned with great complication and time plus the trouble shooting expense of the hired tech guy to install and troubleshoot.  Next came the disappointment that although these speakers link with SiriusXM, the connection is dropped within a minute or two.  The speaker system will not sustain a connection with SiriusXM.  The music is my main reason for wanting an in home speaker system and this did not live up to its promises, was expensive to purchase and has been expensive to pay a tech guy to troubleshoot defective equipment and Amazon wasted more than an hour of my time with zero customer support and time wasted in the impossible return process.

Second, I noticed when I played my playlist it had songs missing, so it tells me if I want the missing songs back I have to upgrade to amazon music unlimited for $7.99 a month which makes no sense cause I'm doing amazon music unlimited for  $2.99 a month already. I plugged my 3rd gen back in and the songs on my playlist all came back free of charge and were all there. So I plug my 4th gen back in hoping somehow the issue fixed itself and it's back to telling me I need to pay $7.99 a month again. Seriously? What's wrong with this dysfunctional product?

So I followed the instructions to get my existing Bose speakers added as devices, than created the groups.

I want all three speakers (including the Echo) playing the same thing in synch, controlled by Alexa.  When I tried to get Alexa to do it she asks for a speaker to group, I say ""SoundTouch"" and she says she can't find ""SoundTouch"" then searches and says ""I found SoundTouch, should I add that speaker?""

So, as a solution, I bought an Amazon Echo to one simple task: wake me up to what is essentially a commercial-free radio of my own music library. Alexa doesn't even have the capability to do that! If I pick a playlist to wake me up, it ALWAYS starts with the first song on the playlist, and it ALWAYS starts with shuffle mode turned off. I've tried asking it to shuffle my playlist when setting my alarm, leaving Spotify on shuffle the night before, and asking Alexa to turn shuffle mode on the night before, but none of them work--it wakes me up with shuffle off. Why is this simple wish so difficult to fulfill? I couldn't find an iPhone app that does this, which is why I bought an Echo.

I finally decided to buy the full sized Echo for our living room, as we often play music and other things as a family in this room. I was excited to have better speaker quality and was willing to pay a little more for it.After 2 days, we noticed the sound would crack, in addition to everything sounding a bit muffled. I tried adjusting the equalizer to reduce bass, assuming that was the cause of the muffled sound, but no dice. Still sounded like it was behind a door or under water.  Not to mention, the random crackles of sound.Amazing was great, and offered a replacement over Support Chat. But\u2026 the replacement sounds just as poorly out of the box.We\u2019ve got a third device coming - I\u2019m not giving up yet (so many good reviews, right??) but I\u2019m not optimistic.

Customer service told me online that it will simply be replaced, since it is within warantee, and to follow instructions to send the bad one back.

So one customer service tells me that the new one is ordered and will be here in 3-5 business days, another tells me that I will get nothing until they get the broken one and fix it then send it back, and now I am on perpetual hold because the phone operators are too busy goofing off to actually provide any kind of completent assistance.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

This is not an improvement or an ugrade of any kind.,"\nI wanted to replace a 2nd Gen Dot with a full size Echo.  It was just when the pre-order for Echo 4th Gen opened.  I figured, ""Sure!  This will be good!""  Unfortunately I was very, very wrong.I, like other purchasers, have the issue of poor microphone sensitivity.  I find myself repeating ""Alexa"" about 3 times before it wakes up.  I'll give it a command and it will just wait in limbo until I repeat the command.Additionally, like other purchasers,  I don't like that it came with a white power cord.  It looks stupid with a charcoal unit.The sound quality is AWFUL!  I believe part of the issue is that the speaker is angled from 1/2 way up the front to the base of the back.  The rest of the top is just plastic, not speaker.  I didn't think about it at the time but it's a stupid design.  Sound is being pushed out and down.  Perhaps if I put it on a high shelf it would sound better but should I HAVE to place it on a high shelf to be able to hear it properly?Interestingly, I was charged full price for the ""free"" Philips bulb that was included with the pre-order.  I hadn't actually noticed until just the other day.  So they screwed me on that.I would have returned the Echo 4th Gen but, like an idiot, I threw away the box before I realized how bad a product it is.

Fills the room better and has better bass. To test the sound between the two I used siriusxm symphony hall. Sad I wanted Alexa to be more. I was really hoping for more.Future proof? - not sure who will be the better long term investment but for now Google offers a little more for less. I really wanted Alexa to knock my socks off, but it just fell flat for me. For the price of Alexa Echo premium sound you can get two mini's.Sorry.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo

Auto Bluetooth Connect - Alexa announces whenever a bluetooth device is connected. You dont have any control over that to disable Auto-Connect. You might be listening to music on your phone and then you powerup your laptop and it will connect to your laptop and switches back and forth sometimes. The only solution Amazon has given, is to Forget your device from bluetooth settings EACH time you are done using it.2. Announcements! - I tried disabling this but Alexa wont stop announcing every time I connect a device to Alexa and its so loud.

I think its cool but it takes up more room so I had to move some things around....The light being at the bottom is annoying and dumb to me, I understand that they were going for it reflecting off of what its on but....personally I do not have or do I like White Furniture and that seems to be what it would do best on, I use Light wood or dark wood and this does horrible at showing the light off.  I never notice when I have a notification  nor can I see if it heard me without getting closer to it.

My Gen 4 device was defective: both hard of hearing (my Gen 1 Dot 30' away in another room would hear me and with this device I had to yell to get it to activate) and the speaking voice sounded muffled compared to my other devices. Other dislikes: I ordered a black Echo but it came with a white cable. It's a minor point but I think a black cable would be more appropriate. Worse however was that the cable is ridiculously short (compared to all my Gen 1 devices) which limits placement without the need for an extension cord. Overall, fairly disappointed and returned. HOWEVER, aside from the cord color and length which would have still resulted in my returning the device, I'm hoping that my ""operationally defective device"" was an anomaly and I just got a bad one. Overall, my wife and I enjoy the conveniences Alexa adds to our smart home and this poor review shouldn't deter you from trying out Alexa if you never have.

I actually look forward to buying the new generation each time.So I\u2019m really, really disappointed with this fourth generation. Its smaller form factor means its microphone is physically located much closer to its base, so if you had your Echo+ on a side table (like me), expect your experience to take a serious nosedive. I repeat myself four or five times, getting louder each time sometimes. I have an echo dot in the next room and about 25% of the time IT picks up before the Echo 4th gen does.An overall downgrade, unfortunately. Making devices smaller is not always an improvement.

The alexa app, while better than the google equivalent, still leaves a lot to be desired in terms of finding features.The one feature however that makes me regret my purchase more than anything else though is that you effectively cannot share the device with other household members if you have any intention of using smart home features.Any other users of the echo devices must have full access to your amazon account and be logged in as you. You can set up a household and link ONE more adult's amazon account, but then they have no access to any smart home routines or devices, rendering the whole exercise pointless.I did not see any of these limitations before buying several echos to replace my google devices, however now that I'm aware of it I was able to find complaints about this very thing going back several years. It seems amazon has no intention of adding such a basic feature that every one of their competitors can do.

I got the device and could not get the temperature sensor to work. It would not notify me of a temperature drop unless I pushed the play button on the routine. I also couldn't get Guard to notify me of my smoke alarm going off. I spent 8 hours or more on the phone over numerous days with Amazon technical support. I had support staff tell me that Echo Gen 4 didn't have a temperature sensor. I had them tell me that Guard doesn't notify you unless you pay a monthly fee. They had very little idea how to set up the temperature drop notification. Even after all those hours, we were never able to get the temperature sensor to notify me either on my phone or even over the Echo setting in the same room. After much investigation, there is a note on Amazon about Guard that it ""does not detect all smoke alarms"". So this product was pretty much worthless to me.

This is much worse at hearing our voice (wake word or otherwise) in our open family/kitchen area. We find ourselves yelling at it, angrily, way more. And the sound quality? Much worse. I'm not an audiophile. I was happy listening to music on the old one, including at high volume. The new one is bass-heavy and just not as clear. And forget turning it up past volume ""4"", when it just becomes noise. In addition, the speakers (and probably the mic) are directional, so things get even worse if you happen to be outside its sweet spot 45 degree cone of mediocrity. It's designed for the corner of a room, but it only makes sense in the middle of my room. Maybe I'd be better with a Dot, which is just sad.Overall, a big disappointment. But you want some pluses?

I thought it was good, and hadn't put in my lights and TV to work with Alexa.  I finally took some time to add the features into Alexa, as I had the features on another Echo tower which went bad after 1 1/2 years.  I spent 8 hours in one day trying to make the Alexa work with my lights and TV.  I ended up calling the TV company,  the switch plug company, along with the internet company, and many calls back and forth with Amazon.  I had purchased a 3rd generation Alexa Dot months ago before I ordered the 4th generation, so I thought I would try and hook it up, to my lights and TV,  finding out it was easy to do  and it works great with my lights and TV.  Plus I find the sound on the Echo 3rd Gen Dot is far better than the 4th Echo ball.  Very disappointing and suggest you save your money and get the 3rd Gen Dot.  They have a great special on it now for 18.99, which will end soon,  so I bought another one  This is the first time I have ever done a review but I was so upset on how much time and aggravation I went through I had to let other people know.  Save your money this product is not good in my opinion.\n",47 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

But failed multiple times when trying to get it to join existing Alexa groups already in the house, because it was 'unrecognized network'.  Only way to have all the Echo speaker groups to integrate was to reset router (Nighthawk Mesh) to factory settings and rebuild the entire house network of wi-fi devices using new network name and password, which took alot of time.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Echo

Both echo devices were connected in the same location, approximately centered in a modestly sized kitchen/living room with an open floor plan.Even when the room is quiet, the echo doesn\u2019t always hear me or my wife\u2019s voice when spoken to at a moderate level.  With a newborn sleeping baby in our arms, it is unfortunate that we have to raise our voices to activate the echo.We are considering returning the echo and reattaching the 1st generation.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Echo
