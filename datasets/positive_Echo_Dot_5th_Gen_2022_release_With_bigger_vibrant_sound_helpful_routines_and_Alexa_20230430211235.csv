Echo_Dot_5th_Gen_2022_release_With_bigger_vibrant_sound_helpful_routines_and_Alexa,29.99,,,Pizzle,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on October 21, 2022","""UPDATE 3"" - It has some downsides but good overall.","\nFINAL UPDATE!!!If you have a dot already and you're not in a rush to update you're not missing out. The sound quality is better. Like most people I connect my dot to a Bluetooth speaker. So the updated sound quality is mute.The Eero installed mesh wifi is cool if you need to kill a dead zone. Definitely worth it ONLY IF you already have and Eero or plan on getting one. Tech support isn't the best in this department. Read below. When I did get the tech support in the U.S. the knowledge of the Eero wifi was much better. The Tech Support they out source to foreign countries is terrible. They told me the Dot and the Eero don't work together because I didn't buy them together. Amazon was quick to give me a phone call after my review so know that they do read reviews and in good faith will do everything to rectify the problem (A huge plus for Amazon.)So the problem I had was not with the Echo Dot, but with the Eero wifi mesh extender.With the Eero it's all about placement when it comes to these Echo dots. You want your Echo to be in the 5ghz range and NOT the 2.5Ghz. range. Do what you can to get the hub closer. It makes a HUGE difference. I did some digging online and found out that the Eero does well and placed up high also. I purchased a 100 foot cat5 network cable ($17). I Moved the Eero hub to the center of the house. I set it on top of a cabinet. The back room, where I was pulling 5-20mps is up to 432mps download. That's without using the Eero extension on the Echo Dot.The dot has a motion sensor and tempurature sensor that works with my Smartthings Hub. I have not used them because I already have motion and temp sensors in this room that have active scenarios working.I'm going to keep this one and test the sensors a bit more and compare them to ones I have set up already.I would give this four stars but I can't overlook the comedy of foreign tech support. This would've been a frustrating experience if I was pressed to get things working.ANOTHER UPDATE!!!!This junk is going back to the pit of hell it came from. Both of them. It's a good idea but fails in its execution.The Eero built into these are random. Sometimes you connect, sometimes you don't. I could stand a foot away from it and it will not connect to the Eero.This is a BRAND NEW product. If you buy this know that you are part of the BETA TEST crowd. You are the guinea pigs that Amazon is perfecting this on. So you pay your money so they can test this out.On one of my many calls to tech support they told me they only had very little training on these.The old wifi worked better than this.IT IS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME!!!!!!!!  WAIT TILL THEY WORK THE KINKS OUT!!!!New update!!!They don\u2019t know what the hell they are doing at tech support.Stupid stuff I was told.1. It will only work when you buy them together. (The Eero and Echo dot with Eero installed.)Firmware needs to update. \u201cHow do I do that?\u201d I ask. \u201cI escalated the ticket to a higher level tech support.\u201d I hung up. Called back and got a different tech. They told me to update simply tell Alexa,\u201dAlexa, update firmware.\u201d Like I told the other tech, the firmware is updated. Two tech calls ago the guy did it.So now they say they gotta call me back because they need to figure it out. LOL!!!!!STOOOOPID!This gets worse and worse. So now I\u2019m on the phone AGAIN with tech support. This idiot told me the Echo Dot with EERO won\u2019t work with the Eero mesh I purchased because ,\u201dI did not buy them together.\u201d What special kind of stupid is this!! So Eero is putting their name on products that do NOT work with other EERO products. I asked to speak to someone else. I\u2019ve been on hold for 20min.Amazon got something\u2019s right but this is a mess.Tech support has no clue on how to fix this. I\u2019m going to return this crap. But now I want to see how dumb tech support is.They asked which model do I have.There\u2019s only one with EERO in it.She didn\u2019t know that.Ten minutes later and I\u2019m back on the phone with tech support. Signal drops constantly. Tech support no help on this one hot piece of garbage!!!!I spent some time on the phone with tech support. This had to be configured so the Eero would work. I\u2019m getting good download speeds now. I hope it lasts. The sound is a bit of an improvement. More bass and highs. It\u2019s not easy to set up the Eero. They had to. Get inside and configure it to work. A hassle but it works. Tech support for Amazon can\u2019t help. Call the Eero hot line.This won\u2019t even hold the wi-fi signal. My router is the the living-room. The download speeds standing next to the Eero mesh wifi is great. 550mps.In the office I installed the New Echo dot with eero installed for mesh. Without the Echo dot I\u2019m getting 91mps. That\u2019s just off the Eero transmitting from the living room. Better than I expected.Now when I hook the Echo Dot up and I run the test.I get a whopping 0.14 mbps download. I\u2019m sitting a foot away from it.Total garbage.\n",446 people found this helpful,Color: Deep Sea BlueConfiguration: Device only

Works well - but there are bugs - be aware,"\nOk, bugs first: Adaptive listening is a huge problem. It causes Alexa to mis recognize things. For me, telling Alexa to turn on either the Office AC or the bedroom AC caused her to turn on EVERYTHING in the room. BEfore you start giving me suggestions - don't waste your breath. I have already spoke with tech twice and PROVEN that there is a bug in the adaptive listening that causes her to do things she was not asked to do or to NOT do things she was asked to do.Otherwise, it's PERFECT! There are some issues still with other apps that interact with Alexa, but those aren't her fault!Overall, I'm SUPER happy I moved from Google Home devices to the Echo devices! I'm still learning, but overall pretty happy with them at this point!\n",3 people found this helpful,Color: Deep Sea BlueConfiguration: Device only

And it came with this light bulb that I can tell Alexa to dim it to whatever percentage I want to and to turn it on and off whenever I want to which is actually really cool.It would be nice if behind the cloth that in cases this little sphere, that it would display the time and temperature. But at last, it does not, so now I either have to speak out loud and ask Alexa or I have to go get my phone and look at it to see the time. It's trivial but and actually makes a big difference compared to if it did or did not have that feature.They also make it a pain in the butt for the setup procedure. Most people just want to screw the lightbulb in plug in the Alexa and tell it to play music or tell it to tell me the forecast of the day and to set an alarm and to dim a light or turn it off or make it brighter. I don't need 600 questions during the setup procedure. It's like, just let me set it up and get the basics and I can find tune it later. You don't buy a house and then get asked $6,000 things that you want to do to your house and your hopes and dreams for the house. You literally just address those things as they come along while you live at the house. And that's how it should be with this speaker thing. I'm just a man who doesn't have a lot of patience and I acknowledge that, so that's just purely a subjective opinion from an inpatient man that appreciates the sound quality and features of this Amazon Alexa speaker thing\n",One person found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: w/ Philips Bulb

I have three of these devices in three different places around my house, every place has a different temperature yet they all seem to report the same temperature that is NOT an average either so..... what is it measuring then?Sound is where it lacks the most. The sound reproduction is dull, even kind of muffled. If you got it as a BT speaker to actually enjoy music then look somewhere else. I have found that sound is VERY inconsistent between these devices. I have a few echo 3 devices and they sound ""ok"" but one of them has SUPERB sound. It baffles my mind how this can be possible, but there it is.All in all, it is a good device and I recommend it, hence why I keep buying them. BUT it depends if you are going to use them at their fullest or just as a BT speaker. If for only the latter, then look somewhere else.\n",4 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

One friend gave me a demonstration of how easy and fast it was to obtain an internet radio station. Or how quickly it will solve mathematical problems. I was convinced, and bought one. Liked it so much I immediately ordered 4 more. Turns out you can synchronize all of them, so they play the same radio station or music in each room of your home. Although Alexas are smaller than a softball, they have amazingly rich sound. No, they won't replace my $2500 stereo system, but they have replaced all my internet radios and boom-boxes. Soon, I'll be installing electric switches the Alexa can control. Buy an Alexa. You'll like it !\n",7 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only
Echo_Dot_5th_Gen_2022_release_With_bigger_vibrant_sound_helpful_routines_and_Alexa,29.99,,,foooter,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States \U0001f1fa\U0001f1f8 on March 29, 2023",Alexa without the ads,"\nI recently traded my Echo Show for this Echo dot. Here's the deal, I originally thought, ""having a screen on the echo that I have in the kitchen will allow me to look at recipes and allow me to see people that ring the doorbell on my blink doorbell!"" But did I ever actually use any of those features? Nope.Now aside from just having extra features that I did not use, I could not stand how many ads would show on the screen regularly. As a parent with toddlers who love to ask about everything they see, the least amount of screens around my house, the better.I enjoy the functionality of Alexa and the integration with my other smart home items, but I'm not sure I'm ready to trade ease of use for ads in my face. As someone who owned the very first Echo that was released, these things have come a long way. The audio quality is by no means killer, but it will definitely serve to play your music or a storybook for your kids with plenty of volume to spare. If you are using the Eero wifi system, this will also serve as a range extender, allowing you to have your other Eero devices in other parts of the house.So in conclusion, unless you are certain that you need another screen in your house, save yourself the money and get this Echo.\n",14 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

(updated 1/12/2023),"\nWe've been using Alexa for years for controlling lights, garage door opener, video doorbell, thermostat, television and streaming!  We are constantly asking Alexa to turn on or off certain lights, or changing light colors, etc.The new gen of Echo Dot has Ultrasound Motion Detection which is a game changer here!  That detection capability can be used to detect motion with adjustable sensitivity and range.  Combined with two new Routines per Echo Dot, one to turn on the lights when motion is sensed and one to turn off lights when there is no motion sensed, we've completely automated lighting in the house.  In the past week I've made the Routines time-based so we can have a brighter white light color during daytimes and a software off white light color as it gets darker outside.So far the only issue with Echo Dot was the placement of all of the Echo Dots.  Here it is very important so we can avoid unnecessary lights going on and off.  It took a week or so to get the combination of placement, motion-detection sensitivity and range dialed in and we are very happy with the results!Now there will be no more fumbling around for light switches when needing a glass of water at night, and no more wasted electric when lights are left on :)  I'm very happy with the Motion Detection features, and it makes a great addition to all of the other features of Alexa's that we use.The one con I've personally faced is now that there are some rooms with more than one Alexa device, the language I used prior with Alexa is ambiguous and she points that out.  That's why I deducted a star.Update 1/12/2023 - One room in the house has a dehumidifier and air purifier and they are running quite often this time of year which generates a constant background noise.  Even with Echo's Ultrasound Motion Detection set to high Sensitivity and Range, I'm finding that I have to snap my fingers or make another noise that is louder than the background noise before the lights are turned on.  However, even with the background noise Echo is able to detect when we leave the room and turns the lights off as expected.  I'm not going to deduct anything from the rating because this makes sense to me, and I believe they'll work this out with a near future updated.Overall I'm still happy with the new generation Echo Dots!\n",33 people found this helpful,Color: Deep Sea BlueConfiguration: Device only

No digital clock, wasn\u2019t expecting it with the darker color option but i don\u2019t think i have met anyone who has not agreed with me that the clock will look much better in the darker color echo. More offset and the matching color combination, even maybe a better contrast making the digital clock light red, orange, or purple? I\u2019m just going to hope that Amazon sees this and uses it, and then all i will want is a new digital version with one of my color ideas. Buy this one for the sound and the 5G connection. I\u2019m having a few issues as I am positive most people can relate. The largest and most frustrating is the combination of speaker environments. I can get this 5th generation echo linked to my 4th generation echo as speakers L and R. They are not able to connect with anything else however. Even if they are disconnected and forgotten from their bond they won\u2019t connect with the other speakers. I speak of one speaker specifically and that\u2019s my top of the line Studio. The greatest speaker, surround sound, Dolby, device hub studio speaker. I\u2019m told over and over that it isn\u2019t compatible with the Alexa devices on network tho can connect with the 2 Sony soundbars I linked together before digital plug in to the TV. Though studio is not able to provide sound for this type of connection. It\u2019s made for a simple audio interfaced system. Preferably the devices that share a name with it\u2026 at a loss. But if you use it Bluetooth from your iPhone the sound is very impressive. Especially when it\u2019s such a small device. Even when it\u2019s having trouble getting connected I still say it\u2019s worth it. Who knows, maybe my problem is specifically mine and not something that is a known issue, I haven\u2019t been able to find many others that are experiencing this issue.. I can say I am very competent with electronics, connections, networking, and other skills learned taking advantage of the free opportunities available from Microsoft, google, amazon, GitHub, and many others. A lot of free resources are available for everyone and I say that you should take full advantage of them as soon as you finish the purchase of your echo 5th gen\n",One person found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: w/ Philips Bulb

I have 4th gen Echos paired with an Echo studio and Echo Show 8 for my sound needs.  I haven't listened to anything on the new dot to tell if the sound is better than the old dot, but my feeling is if you are using an Echo Dot as your main audion input you don't really value sound quality in the first place.  I do think it is in imporvement that the speakers are front firing since most of us have our Echos placed agaisnt a wall.  I'm enjoying all the new things I can make happen with motion detection.

Love the payment options as well gives an opportunity to get multiple at once as gifts. Also gifted one to my Neice last year the gen white 4 and she loves it,  got same for my brother too . Amazing for all ages. Literally we are 8-78yrs. So compact easy to display. Modern looking. Picks up commands well. Gives weather if requested. Download app to make all your preferences easy and personalize it to just you.  Responds to your voice command. Name it with the small choices it gives. We have an Echo, Alexa, and a Ziggy\u2026 we chose different names for our home so when we command her they all don\u2019t go off at once. We set reminders and errand lists.  I do wish they gave more naming options for this purpose but we are lucky we have enough names for the amount owned. We love them. It\u2019s a cool device and everyone should have one! Makes life so easy at times. The pictures listed are of my white gen 4 clock choice but the gen 5 charcoal looks the same just diff color (this gen 5 doesn\u2019t have clock option) . I believe it\u2019s the software that separates the two. Wanted to give you a picture of what would look like. Connect to your Amazon account and will notify you when your packages come, and any updates regarding your account. As you see mine is lit yellow at the base stating I have a notification.

We're Alexa-fying our house as a means for dealing with reduced mobility and increased age-related incidents and needs.Yeah, we're really old. And that tempers our overall response to the Gen5 Echo Dot, which could be summed up as ""Meh.""We were perfectly happy with the basic Gen4 Echo Dot but found that when we wanted to add another unit, G4s are no longer sold except as 'refurbished' or 'open box' - plus the G5 intro bundle was really low cost.The Echo platform is exceptionally useful for our applications, which are out of the ordinary if you're young. For example, we've used ""Alexa, turn on all lights"" a couple of times for dark-of-night incidents where light has been a boon backdrop for noodling out various solutions. Light (literally) brightens up your mood when your mood is under you-just-awoke-suddenly pressures.Plus, while our house is quite modest, it's well built and pretty sound-proof, so yelling from the bedroom to the basement office just doesn't cut it. We now have Echos in every key room, so 'Alexa, drop in on everybody' gives us quick access to a house-wide intercom.But now for our disappointment. We actually have some usage for decent music reproduction, and the 3.5mm headphone output on the Gen4 Echo allows us to plug through to ancient but high-quality computer speakers scavenged from local thrift stores.No such plug is on the Gen5. Our cheap music solution is no longer possible. Sure, we could use Bluetooth speakers, but units with sound quality comparable to quality, vintage computer speakers are (a) a lot more expensive and (b) require pairing, which I've always found quirky/intermittent/frustrating with Bluetooth. Because we are really old, simply plugging a stereo jack into a Gen4 receptacle just seems easier and more reliable.And, while I kind of wanted to taste the new, higher Gen5 sound with increased bass, what I'm hearing is clearly designed for boom-a-boom thumpity thump popular music. It probably won't surprise you to find that sounds eagerly sucked up by 15-30 year olds isn't really what ancient folks like us want. Jazz, classical, (dare I say) Enya, even ""Eres Tu"" with its really nice descant at the end -- this is more our range, and it's stuff that requires reined-in bass, un-tinny midrange, and balanced treble.So, between audio engineering decisions and the audio-output de-contenting, for us, Gen5 is not a step up from Gen4.Like all Echos, build quality is outstanding, software capabilities are outstanding -- in fact, incredibly exciting and clearly with few limits -- and the spherical design is minimalistic and very pleasing. It was great that it took nothing more than plugging it in to marry our new G5 unit to all the other Echos dotted around our house. I'm not sorry we added a Gen5 unit, just not jumping for joy.I find myself pigeon-holing it with all the other recent New! New! Product stuff floating out there that offers less, removes wanted accessories, and otherwise pumps up corporate bottom lines at the expense of what (some) owners want.I may come back and add some more praise for the new temperature monitoring some day, but at the moment, we are years away from an Alexa-compatible thermostat...\n",13 people found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only

The speaker boasts improved sound quality over previous generations, with clear and crisp audio that is perfect for listening to music, podcasts, or audio books. The compact design makes it easy to place the device in any room, and its modern aesthetic fits in well with any decor.One of the standout features of the Echo Dot is its integration with Amazon's Alexa voice assistant. Alexa is user-friendly and has a vast array of skills, from setting reminders and controlling smart home devices to providing information on weather, news, and more. The device also offers seamless integration with popular music streaming services such as Amazon Music, Spotify, and Apple Music.However, there are some areas where the Echo Dot falls short. The built-in microphone array is not as advanced as other smart speakers on the market, which can lead to difficulty in picking up voice commands in noisy environments. Additionally, the speaker doesn't offer the strongest bass response, so it may not be the best option for those looking to play music at high volumes.In conclusion, I would rate the All-New Echo Dot (5th Gen, 2022 release) as a 4-star product. It is a good choice for those looking for a compact and affordable voice-controlled device, but those seeking a high-end smart speaker or superior audio quality may want to look elsewhere.

You need to hard reset the device (hold down the action button for 20+ seconds, longer than you do for pairing mode) and reset unplug / replug your router.  This fixed the problem immediately.Adjusted review from 2 to 5 stars, as now it works properly and the Amazon associates were all over this.  Good customer service.----ORIGINAL REVIEW-----I like the form factor of this Echo Dot but it doesn't seem to respond to the wake word as well as the 2 previous versions (1st Gen and 3rd Gen) that I had.  The audio quality is improved over prior generation of Echos (still doesn't compare to the full Alexa, nor should it be expected to given the size differential).  And it looks a lot better than the prior versions.One downside is that this 5th gen does not come with an aux port, so cannot connect create a wired connection to speakers, as I had done in the past.Don't forget that Amazon has a trade in program for your old Alexa devices, so you can offset the cost of upgrading your Alexa devices.\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: w/ Philips Bulb

First of all, it's a lot more appealing than the previous model. I love that it's a sphere. And it's still a good product in general for it's main purposes. I mainly use it for adding things for my shopping list, alarms, and music... Which brings me to why I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars.... I truly thought that because this new dot was ""bigger and better"" that the sound would be spectacular and crystal clear. Not saying that it's not good, but it's just not great, which is slightly disappointing considering the price. It isn't very loud at it's highest volume and sometimes it just doesn't sound like the highest quality audio experience. And the bass isn't really bass-ing like I thought it would. It's a good product, I just am judging this purely as a speaker because I mainly use it for listening to music. It is veey responsive tho with it's music commands and I love that you can tap to pause now. One day I'll upgrade to a regular Echo because I just need a loud and excellent audio experience 89% of the time.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

It's an Echo Dot.  This review deals with the Eero built-in capability.  This is the ONLY reason that I upgraded to this Echo Dot (from an older Echo Dot (2nd gen)).  It's in a room where I hoped to improve my connections to a couple of Ring cameras that are on the outside walls of that room.  Well, I hooked it up and rebooted the cameras in question. Hmmm, they did not connect to the new Eero node.  Did some research and found buried in the Eero information for the Echo Dot (5th Gen) that it only communicates on the 5 GHz band.  Welp, Ring cameras communicate on the 2.4 GHz band.  Totally will not work for my need.  Wanted to get this out there for anyone that may be purchasing this new Echo Dot for its built-in Eero.

Thirty minute call to eero support and was then routed to Amazon support for a 1:50 call.  The tech finally escalated it to the second level.  We'll see.  Thanks++++UPDATE++++As a echo speaker, it works GREAT.  However, since this arrived a little more than week ago, I have had 5 calls to eero support and two calls to Alexa support to get this unit to extend my eero network.  The total time on these calls exceeded 7 hours with one being 1:50 and two more at an hour each.Although the dot showed 4 bands of wi-fi signal on the eero app, the final solution provided by eero tech support was that I needed to have this new dot sitting closer (in my case, within 8 feet of my eeco router for it function as an extender).  This left it in a place (closet) that made no sense for a speaker or move my eero router into our guest bathroom.  The idea that it would improve my mesh network by having this dot 8' closer provided no value.It got shipped back to Amazon today and the frustration of wasting so much time will surely fade but not too quickly.New update (12/14/22):  when these went in sale for $25, I felt I'd give up the extender component and just use it as a better speaker than the old Dot.  The new one arrived and did not extend this time either - but after a week (and two updates from eero), I saw it was extending.  So - maybe it's OK if you are willing to deal with some frustration and/or mixed results\n",One person found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only

I also love the motion sensor which was introduced in the previous 4th Gen.Here\u2019s a picture of one that I\u2019m using with it\u2019s built in people detection to automatically turn on the lights in the garage.  It also starts playing the news briefing when it detects motion.  Although the ultrasonic detection only detects major movements and is not as sensitive as a common PIR (infrared) sensor.I don\u2019t care about the built in eero because I use wired backhaul Ubiquiti UniFi access points for all of my WiFi (the only rock solid WiFi setup after I experimented with many).The only minor negatives: 1. the cord should be black, not white, and 2. I prefer the hockey puck shape (with rounded edges) of the 3rd Gen Echo Dot which has the light ring on top.  The low profile shape of the 3rd Gen hides on the desk better and makes it easier to quickly access the top controls.  For this reason I\u2019m only going to upgrade to 5th Gen in locations where I need the motion or temp sensor.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

The narrator's voice is a lot clearer.  It is so clear that I just bought a second Echo Dot 5th Generation.I have not used the 5th Generation for music yet.  I use other Echo devices for music.

It has better audio quality over-all and more bass than the 4th gen Dot, which I also own. It also has more trebble but less mid-range than the 4th gen Dot. I prefer the audio this new way personally, but you can still adjust the equalizer on the built-in speaker if you want the mids back.One thing to note, this 5th gen Echo Dot has no aux/headphone jack, so if you want to use external speakers you have to use Bluetooth. I think the jack is useful as Bluetooth isn't always 100% reliable and disconnects sometimes. Also some older speakers don't support Bluetooth, so to use them you need a Bluetooth-to-aux adapter. I'd honestly get the older Dot if you just want to add Alexa to external speakers and don't care so much about the quality of the built-in speaker.However the built-in thermometer/temperature sensor is nice, I was able to get the indoor temp just by asking Alexa. This actually isn't the 1st device to include such a sensor, but it's the cheapest to do so thus far. Also the motion detector seems useful but I haven't played around with that feature much.I can't comment on the Wi-Fi extending capabilities because I don't have an Eero system. It would be nice if this device worked to extend other brands of mesh networks or even standalone routers...Over-all if you're looking for a speaker to fill a small to medium-sized space with decent sound on the cheap, this device is for you. But don't expect booming bass or extremely loud music for this price-range. The volume does get loud, but at higher levels it compresses the audio to sound louder while avoiding distortion.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

Just opened Alexa and it detected that a device was ready for set up, didn't have to enter passwords for wifi either, just selected network (all my smart devices are on one network while other stuff on another).  Sound isn't bad, will see how it does as part of a multiroom set up, but I have to confess I don't have much luck with multi-room music with the Echoes, it always seems to have issues - I get messages saying it's playing somewhere else but it's not, it cuts out, buffers and just stops or doesn't start at all.I really bought this because it says it has a temperature sensor which I wanted so I can check the temperature where my birds are without having to physically read the thermometer where they are so I can now set up a routine to turn on or off the fans when the temperature is above or below a certain value.\n",10 people found this helpful,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only

Selecting the choice when ordering to have these preconfigured to my account made setup extremely easy.  And they seem to work well, except one thing.  The inside temperature thermometer is not accurate on any of the units.  They all read 2-7 degrees cold, and don't seem to respond much at all to changes in room temperature.  I was sort of looking forward to this feature, but primarily bought the updated units because they were on sale and my old ones were past getting security updates.Although I have Eero mesh routers I have not tried the router extender function on these for two reasons.  First, I don't have a wide area to cover and I've found with other mesh systems you can have too many connection points.  My three router pods are adequate.  Second, I keep these devices on my guest network, and the extender function won't work on guest networks.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

I purchased it as I needed to extend my wifi and thought this was a great concept.  Replace an old Dot and get wifi extension for eero without the added device.  Set up was super easy.  The only problem was the Wifi extension would not work for me.  After set up and then getting eero to activate the wifi extension I started getting messages that it would not.  eventually telling me that it was to close to another eero device.  I am in the area of the house signal is week, were I need the extension to exist.  If I moved the device further away into the next area it did connect and worked fine.  Unfortunately that put it into my garage where I did not want this device I need.  Apparently, My house is not that big.  So Ultimately it worked great.  I just couldn't set up the wifi extension as I needed another 10 feet.  So I returned and bought another eero that worked fine and the old Dot still works wonderfully.  Make sure you have enough distance from another erro module for the wifi extension feature to work.\n",14 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

I moved the clocked version to another room where these issues were not a factor.

I don\u2019t use my dots as alarms so the tap to snooze function is kind of irrelevant for me. But in the living room the sound is noticeably better (and louder) than the previous generation with richer tones.The only thing that would truly make this superb is if the temperature sensing capabilities were better integrated with other devices (I\u2019m talking to you ecobee!) but then ecobee wouldn\u2019t be able to charge $100 for their sensors anymore.Overall, a good upgrade and it\u2019ll be even better when other devices start to make use of its upgrades too.Also, these would be amazing for surround sound effects IF they worked with the other streaming devices.

My Echo ran a firmware update immediately. I then was asked to update EERO, both updates ran smoothly. I then launched the EERO app and turned on Eero built in. I keep getting error message to check for software update. Already done !  I have jacked with this for over 3 hours. I rebooted Echo and eero and even my modem  The only way to get the error to go away is turn off eero built in. The only reason I bought this junk is to extend WIFI. I recently received ASTRO and have already had issues with that. Not happy Amazon customer.  ****This appears to be a problem with EERO and not the dot.

The device is compact, easy to set up, and has a sleek modern design that fits perfectly into any room.One of the standout features of the Echo Dot is its voice control capabilities. With Amazon's virtual assistant, Alexa, I can control my smart home devices, play music, and get answers to my questions simply by using my voice. It's a convenient and hassle-free way to stay connected and in control of my home. For example, I can turn off the lights in my bedroom or adjust the thermostat without ever having to leave my couch. I can also ask Alexa to play my favorite playlist or set a timer for when I'm cooking dinner. The options are endless and it's amazing how much easier it has made my daily routine.In addition to its voice control capabilities, the Echo Dot also has impressive sound quality. It's clear and crisp, making it perfect for streaming music or listening to audiobooks. I particularly love using it to listen to podcasts or music while I'm working or relaxing at home.Overall, I highly recommend the All-New Echo Dot (5th Gen) to anyone looking to upgrade their smart home or add voice control to their home. It's a game-changing device that I use on a daily basis and has made my life so much more convenient. The setup process is a breeze and the device is very user-friendly, so even if you're not tech-savvy, you'll have no problem getting it up and running. If you're on the fence about purchasing the Echo Dot, I can confidently say that it's worth the investment. You won't be disappointed!\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only

First of all, we already have one Alexa in the house that belongs to my 16 year old son and he mostly uses it for listening to music and controlling his bluetooth LED lights and lightbulb in his room! My daughter didn't ask for the Alexa, but since she does have the bluetooth lights in her room, I figured she may enjoy being able to do voice control commands like her brother. I also ordered her a bluetooth lighbulb for her ceiling fan that works with Alexa! She has had an absolute blast controlling the lights in her room; the bulb I ordered can do every possible shade of color under the Sun...so my daughter is literally in her room like, ""Alexa change my light to hot pink...Alexa change my light to beige..."" It is SO cool! When she can't sleep, she simply says, ""Alexa play meditative storm sounds"" and Alexa replies with her options... for FREE of course! We can also ask her to read my daughter a bedtime story and she reads a story. Her Dad and I even creeped by her room and said really loud, ""Alexa, play ZZ TOP!"" just to annoy her lmao It's been so much fun and Alexa, like Siri, can answer just about any question or complete just about any task you ask of her.

It\u2019s a good projector however it has its flaws. The sound quality is absolute crap and the fan is loud. I eventually got used to the mono sound (which had to be turned up because the fan is so loud) I recently got the new echo 5 gen and fire stick 4k max during primeday. I and what a complete 180\xb0 difference it is. You can connect the echo with the fire stick and use that as the audio! At first I was worried about there being a delay and the voice not being in sync since I was using a projector. Never had an issue. I have excellent sound now and I\u2019m planning on purchasing another echo to have a both sides of the bed.

As far as the Echo smart speakers, I love them. They sound great on their own or paired together in a stereo configuration(much better). To have synchronized sound throughout the entire house as easy as this is just awesome. Having smart lights and plugs, everything is voice controlled. Even my smart TV since it\u2019s Alexa ready. After I updated my software, since I kind of forgot I had those old dot\u2019s, everything set themselves up on their own. I of course had to tell them what room they were in. It wasn\u2019t hard to set up my house and now it\u2019s all voice activated. The upgrade to high def digital sound in Amazon Music is a must, you will be able to hear the difference. Since I got my gen 2 dot\u2019s, which were a pain in the a@# to control my lights by voice and music only sounded good through my stereo, they have greatly improved. You can get an Echo, not the dot, for 50 bucks on sale. It\u2019s comparable to something worth 3 or 4 times that. The gen 5 dot sounds great in a smaller room. Good base for such a little thing. The 4th gens were good but the 5th is a little clearer and deeper.\n",3 people found this helpful,Color: Deep Sea BlueConfiguration: Device only

This was also the case with the previous version)The new Echo Dot 5 is visually very similar to the 4th gen version from 2020, but these are some nice functionality improvements.-The speakers have been upgraded, now with more focus on low end and bass volume.  I have tested out a few different types of music, and I would agree that there is noticeable improvement, but really the speaker is still too small to be very impressive.  The sound is not even close to a regular Echo device, let alone higher quality speakers.  I appreciate the improvement here, but I still wouldn\u2019t choose to listen to music on these on a regular basis, especially at high volume where there is a bit of distortion.-I like the ability to be able to trigger routines based on temperature and motion, and stopping alarms by tapping is also a nice feature.  These additions offer many more useful automation options, and now having multiple Echo devices with temperature sensors can help identify differences in room temperature throughout the house.-The Eero Wi-Fi extender ability could actually be very useful for some people that need to extend the range of their network.  This was easy to configure with the Eero app, and it seems to be working well so far.Overall, this is a nice little upgrade from the previous version.  The speaker/sound improvement is nice, but not the biggest deal since these Echo Dots are still not the best choice for high volume music.  The sensors and Eero extender features are the biggest improvements, and these changes add so much extra functionality to an already useful smart speaker.  The lack of an audio-out port is the only downgrade, but that might be important to some people.  I also wish they included different color power adapters and cables, but that is also not the biggest deal.  I will be grabbing a few of these new Dots, since the Eero Built-In will come in handy for certain places we need to extend coverage.\n",,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

In the meantime, I watched Amazon continue to invest in new products and new features. But Google was doing what I wanted and I continued to invest in their hardware. However, at some point Google engineers decided that we all wanted to hear more from our smart devices. Commands that used to simply prompt a ""ding"" at some point became "" Got it! Playing (artist) from your Google playlist on Kitchen Music"". And when you simply wanted to pause or stop, it was the same thing: "" Got it! Stopping music on Kitchen Music"". So like if someone called on the phone while music was playing you had to wait till ""G-Man"" was done spouting off to answer.

Sounds good, better than Dot 4. Nice to link them together to play music in multiple rooms at the same time. Dislike that the light keeps swirling and rotating during the night, so I have to unplug it every night. Wish I could have been able to turn it off but haven't figured it out yet. Wanted to use it to listen to nice music to go to sleep to or wake up to. Had some difficulties with getting it to work, but Amazon tech support was very good. Wish there would be a list of typed commands, because guessing them is not working for me. At times both dots need upgrades and they do not perform until you call someone and sit on the phone for an hour or so to upgrade it and get it reset. That's bad. It's happened at least four times in less than a year with Dot 4. Hopefully I don't have to keep calling them back to get it to respond. At times, having to repeat myself over and over different manners before it recognizes what it's supposed to do. It's because I can't get a typed list of appropriate commands from anyone. I am not a computer techie, And finally got my first smartphone a year ago,so it's frustrating. You have to have an app on your smartphone to set them up and make them work, or to change settings, alarms, etc. Again, wish there was some printed literature somewhere or even online but I have been told by Amazon techs there is nothing. With constantly changing technology, it seems like they would put something out. Love the idea that I can plug it in outside and play music instead of bringing my giant boombox outside in the summer.

I have the eero mesh system to connect it to . I then moved it and has to reset the internet on it and then it found the better eero to  connect with .This works good , I believe it is a much nicer sounding dot when comparing to the first generation . I like how you can move this around without loosing the power to it , just like the tap from years ago , just unplug the power cord and you have music on the go .I bought the blue dot and black base and comes with a white cord . Some people complain about the color not being black , I used a permanent black marker to color my cord , problem solved . Yes it should have come in black if ordering black .Hope this last for a long time like all the other devices I have .Would i recommend this , yes especially if you have the original one like me , I\u2019m just cheap and wanted something a little nicer and similar to the old tap .\n",,Color: Deep Sea BlueConfiguration: Device only

We also have a $8,000 HTD whole house wired music distribution system we installed over 10 years ago.  We find that unless we want to play at loud levels (which we virtually never do) the sound from our various Amazon devices all playing at the same time provides nearly the same quality of music as does our whole house system, so we made the decision to deprecated the HTD system and focus on improving the sound quality of our Amazon Echo/Dot system.  To that end we purchased 2 of these new 5th gen Dots to upgrade existing 2nd and third gen Dots.  For some time, we thought the Gen 3 dots were more than adequate as when tested side by side with the gen 2 dots there was an incredible improvement in sound.  We skipped the Gen 4 dot due to the numerous bad reviews on its sound quality and volume, but to be fair we never tested one.  In any case,  despite how impressed we were with the sound of the Gen 3, when played side by side with this new Gen 5, there is no comparison.  The 5 is amazingly better.  We had already replaced most of our gen 2 Dots with Gen 3s, and now we're likely to replace most of those with these new Gen 5s.  Expensive, but in the long run it will provide a very nice listening environment.We also have one of the Gen 4 Echos (not the Dot).  Being much larger in size and designed with music as a priority, the sound from the Gen 4 Premium Sound Echo is definitely better - more expansive, clearer, broader speaker responses, etc.  However, we've found that to only be true at higher volumes.  We don't use the Echo at those higher volumes and at moderate volumes, one has to listen fairly closely to hear an meaningful improvement over the 5th gen Dot.We will probably end up with 2 Gen 4 Premium Sound Echos and the most of the rest of our system will be Gen 5 Dots and keep only a few Gen 3 Dots where we don't really have a need for better sound.Overall, I think the Gen 5 Dot is a very good music delivery device.  We don't use the 3.5mm jack that was left off this new generation of Dot, and my wife notes that most walls are white so she prefers the white cord over the black that many wish Amazon would offer, at least with the black Dots.\n",4 people found this helpful,Color: CharcoalConfiguration: Device only

It's small and sleek, enabling it to fit in any place in my house. The sound quality is excellent; it is far more vibrant and powerful than the previous generation.The Alexa integration is flawless; I can easily control my smart home devices, play music, and request information. I also like the new design of the light ring because it is more subtle and fits in with my decor.One feature that I really like is the ability to connect to other Echo devices, which allows me to play music throughout my entire house. I also like the extra privacy features, such as the ability to mute the microphone with a single button press.Overall, I'm very pleased with the All-New Echo Dot.

About a minute I would say. I unplug and re plug this in different rooms that I will be in for awhile. This had a little weight, but not heavy. I highly recommend. Giftable.

After setting it up, answering a lot of questions about privacy and demonstrating some of the things it can do their attitudes changed to cautious curiosity.  As I write this review one day later I doubt I could pry this away from them if I tried!  They are loving it!Setup was very easy as long as you have a smartphone with the alexa app installed.  I did run into an initial wifi setup issue which was resolved simply by resetting the Alexa dot. Pairing the dot to 2 smart plugs was trivial and only took a couple of minutes.  Voice recognition was excellent even before running the customization routine.The sound on this device is outstanding!  One of the main reasons I bought it was so my mom could play music for my dad who has dementia. Quite frankly I was blown away by how good this thing sounds!  Think home theater quality...All in all I would highly recommend this Alexa dot!

As someone who isn't super tech-savvy, I was worried about setting it up and using all the features, but it was actually super easy and user-friendly.The voice control is definitely the standout feature for me. It's so convenient to be able to control my smart home devices and play music just by talking to the Echo Dot. And Alexa is pretty good at understanding what I'm saying, too. The sound quality is also really good for such a small speaker. I've been using it to listen to music and podcasts and it sounds great.I also really appreciate the sleek design of the Echo Dot. It's small and discreet, so it doesn't take up much space and fits in well with my home decor. The built-in speaker is a nice touch, too. I don't have a home phone, so it's been really handy to be able to make and receive calls with the Echo Dot.Overall, I'm really happy with my purchase.

I tried replacing it earlier with a prior version of this globe shaped one, which didn't work as well for me.This newer one has much better sound quality than either of the earlier ones. It has the added benefit of knowing the temperature. The limitation is that the Alexa app won't allow me to issue multiple separate commands in a routine. It will let you connect several with ""and"" but there's a low limit for the length of a command. So I couldn't have an Alexa routine that told me the temperatures in multiple places very well.It also adds Eero, which I don't use, but since the price didn't go up, it's nice to have something that might be handy in the future.\n",,Color: Deep Sea BlueConfiguration: Device only

I am unsure how to best use Alexa, other than to play music, ask for the temperature, tell me terrible jokes, or just whisper to her to hear her whisper back. I will find new and crazy things. But best of all...the speaker sound is tremendous! I look forward to being assigned my personal NSA, FBI, or CIA agent! Which one will it be?

Very surprising range for such a small speaker. I am so sold on these echo dots and have to travel between three locations where i maintain an apartment and two homes and I don't have to get expensive sound systems to enjoy my music.  Plus, it's so easy to control the lights from anywhere which is a real plus for me coming into different places and not having to worry about ""where am I and where is the light switch.""\n",,Color: Glacier WhiteConfiguration: Device only
